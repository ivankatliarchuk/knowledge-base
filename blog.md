I'm planning to write a blog about a journey moving from from Gitlab docker+machine that is deprecated to
gitlab CI jobs on kubernetes. This is not a full journey, just specific part where were a bit stuck on what is the right approach
of doing certain things, mainly because there is zero guidance from Gitlab and as we migrating every major Gitlab version makes a breaking changes to a workflow.

Write a blog please with sections. Use a long-short-short-short-long-short-long-short-short sentence structure. Please dont be yappy but maintain professionalism and be human, we are writing to engineering and non-engineering audience, as well as to Gitlab so they looks at better developer experiences.
