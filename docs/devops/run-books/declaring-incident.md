# CMOC Checklist

## Shift Start


## Declaring an Incident

checklist for starting and incident:

- [ ] For the CMOC - post in #incident-management that you are the CMOC - cross post to #support_gitlab-com if needed
- [ ] Create the production issue if possible.  In slack:  `/start-incident` or if you have an alert in alerts-general - click the Open Issue button in the thread.
- [ ] Create an incident in http://status.io - make sure you check the options to broadcast to slack, twitter, etc
  * If you don't have full specifics, get the incident created in status.io and first tweet out with a more generic "We are seeing elevated error rates on GitLab.com".  It is better to have a post sooner with investigating than waiting 5 minutes to know more.
- [ ] Create a google doc from the [shared template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NMZllwnK70-WLUn_9IiiyMWeXs-JKPEiq-lordxJAig/edit#)
- [ ] Update Slack and the status.io incident with links to the issue number and google docs.
- [ ] Check with incident team.  Are they all in the same channel, gdoc, on the zoom as needed.  Coordinate and consolidate communication
- [ ] Set a timer for 15 minutes to remind yourself to update status.io and tweet
- [ ] Start to gather overall summary and look to write up an executive summary in the production issue or gdoc for others in the company
- [ ] Check in with incident team:
  * Do they need more people or expertise? Broadcast and ask for help as soon as you know it is needed.
  * Clear the deck - make sure other changes / teams know an incident is going on
  * Clear the deck - cancel other meetings as needed.
