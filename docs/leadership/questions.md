# Questions

## Architecture Questions

* What tradeoffs are you making between ease of building now vs. future maintainability?
* Would you be able to replace tools or modules easily?
* How do you avoid future maintenance and work?
* What are probable product enhancement requests?
* How do you make those easy to build (without completely sacrificing simplicity or maintainability)?

### Future Proofing

* How can we make sure this never happens again?
* Is there a way to add a test or linting or otherwise enforce that no one will make this mistake again?
* Might this project end up with the same or similar problems as something I’ve seen before?

### Due Diligence

* Was the solution carefully thought through?
* What other options were considered?
* If something sub-optimal was chosen, why was it chosen? Is there a path to the more optimal solution? Have they thought that through?
* Is this similar to other problems I’ve seen? If so, would any issues (or successes) we ran into there also apply here?

## Influence

* People won’t always agree with me, but are they hearing me?
* Are people misinterpreting what I’m saying? Are they taking it in the right context? If not, can I change my approach or how I’m presenting my thoughts?
* Do I understand my audience? Are they even the people I should be talking to about this topic? Am I presenting it in a way for them to understand and relate to it?
* How much do I push a topic? Is this a battle worth fighting?

## Ownership

* When I see something wrong, if I don’t fix it, who will?
* What’s stopping me from doing it?
* Am I working on the most important projects? Are the most important projects being worked on?
* What are the weak points or gaps in our technology or our organization? What can I do to fill those?

## Engineering Management

* How does your project affect other teams?
* What’s the ‘adult’ or ‘right’ thing to do? If I’m not doing that, what’s stopping me? Should I probably just do that?
* Am I leading by example? Do I want others copying me?
* How do I create an environment where people feel safe to share their thoughts and opinions?
* Are the people around me motivated and excited about their work and the technical direction? If not, what can I change?
* How do I get others on board?
* How do I get a project or initiative prioritized?
* How do I make sure that people aren’t just blindly following my suggestions, but understand the why?
* Are there similar things that you’re all trying to do?
* Can you generalize your work to make it reusable by another team?

### Grow Everyone

* Who will learn the most from working on this?
* What can I delegate?
* How do I scale myself?
* How can I never answer/do this again?
* Is this particular task really worth the amount of time I’m spending on it? What would happen if it didn’t get done?
* Who else could or should answer this?
* What’s the worst that will happen if I stay out of it?

### Listen Others

* Is everyone’s voice being heard? How do I get others to open up and share their thoughts?
* Am I keeping an open mind to other perspectives?
* If something seems crazy to me, am I truly understanding what they’re saying and where they’re coming from (people are rarely actually crazy)?
* What aren’t people saying?
* Is someone’s body language, actions or demeanor saying something even if they’re not explicitly saying it?
* Have I gotten a diverse set of input? Have I sought feedback from everyone I should?
* Am I amplifying the people who deserve it?

* What experiences have I had that are unique?
* What unique perspectives do I bring to this problem?
* Is there an important perspective that is missing in this conversation? Who can provide that?
