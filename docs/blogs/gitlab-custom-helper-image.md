Using a GitLab runner with a custom helper image offers several advantages:


Customized Environment: You can tailor the helper image to include specific tools, libraries, and dependencies that your CI/CD pipeline requires. This ensures that all necessary components are readily available without needing to install them during each job execution.


Faster Job Execution: With all required tools pre-installed in the custom helper image, you can significantly reduce the time spent on setup and installation steps in your CI/CD jobs. This leads to faster overall execution times.


Consistency Across Jobs: A custom helper image ensures that all jobs run in the same environment, reducing inconsistencies and "it works on my machine" type issues.


Version Control: You can version your helper image, allowing you to maintain different versions of your build environment and easily roll back if needed.


Security: By creating a custom image, you have full control over its contents, allowing you to implement security best practices and ensure that only necessary and vetted components are included.


Reduced Network Usage: With all necessary tools pre-installed, you reduce the need to download dependencies during job execution, which can be particularly beneficial in environments with limited or costly network resources.


Simplified CI/CD Configuration: Many setup steps can be moved from the CI/CD configuration to the helper image build process, resulting in cleaner and more maintainable pipeline configurations.


Support for Specialized Tools: If your project requires specialized or proprietary tools that are not available in standard images, a custom helper image allows you to include these tools easily.


Optimized for Your Workflow: You can optimize the helper image for your specific workflow, including only what's necessary and configuring tools in a way that best suits your project's needs.
