## SIEM Tools

> SIEM tools are an important part of the data security ecosystem: they aggregate data from multiple systems and analyze that data to catch abnormal behavior or potential cyberattacks. SIEM tools provide a central place to collect events and alerts â€“ but can be expensive, resource intensive, and customers report that it is often difficult to resolve problems with SIEM data.
