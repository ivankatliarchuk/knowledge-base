## The plan was as follows for postmortem:

- Be mostly completed prior to the meeting.
- Identify the root cause (and the probability and effect of recurrence).
- Propose at least one action item for fixing the root cause (and estimate effort).
- Propose at least one action item for escape prevention (and estimate effort).
- Propose at least one action item for detection (and estimate effort).
- Each action item must be addressable in the *short* term (i.e. NO half-year projects)
- Action items must be within the owner's sphere of control.
- Each action item must have an assigned individual owner (i.e. no generic ownership)
