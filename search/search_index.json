Absence of a signal is itself a signal. The severity of an incident is measured by the number of rules broken in resolving it. The mobile hotspot you're paying for so you can leave your house while you're oncall only works at home and in the office. The only other person who knows how this works is also on vacation. If a post-mortem follow-up task is not picked up within a week, it's unlikely to be completed at all. That janky script you put together during the outage -- the one that uses expect(1) and ssh -t -t -- now is the foundation of the entire team's toolchest. NTP being off may not be a root cause, but it sure didn't help. UTC or GTFO . Your infrastructure uses a lot more self-signed certificates than you think. A lot more. In places that make you weep. Self-signed certificates beget long lived certs, which beget lack of certificate validity monitoring, which begets curl -k, which begets a lack of certificate deployment automation, which begets self-signed certificates. For any N applications, at most N/2+1 use the same certificate bundle. The system you're troubleshooting doesn't use the one the tool you're troubleshooting it with does. An API without a reference implementation and command-line client is called a gray box. Restricted shells are not as restricted as you think. Very few operations are truly idempotent. \"Asserting state\" beats \"monitoring for compliance\" any day. One in a Million is next Tuesday. People give talks at conferences not to convince others that their work is awesome and totally worth the time and effort they put in, but themselves. It's ok to use shell for complex stuff; it often times is easier, faster, and still less of a mess than juggling libraries and dependencies. There's nothing wrong with Perl. Ok, we all at times keep adding $, {, }, and @ in random places trying to make things work, but still. Serverless isn't. Y38K is already here , it's just not evenly distributed. If you determine \" human error \" as the root cause, then you're doing it wrong. Your network team has a way into the network that your security team doesn't know about. And don't even as much as mention the serial console and IPMI networks, but boy are you glad you have 'em. Blocking TCP port 53 traffic leads to very strange failures. Don't. Somewhere in your infrastructure a service you didn't know uses DNS for endpoint discovery in a very surprising way. Do. Not. Monkey. Around. With. /etc/hosts . If you break it, you own it - for now; if you fix it, you own it - forever. Turning it off and on again is actually quite a reasonable way to fix many things. A README.md in git is no substitute for a manual page that's shipped with your tool. A search for a document you know exists will only turn up links to documents referencing but not actually linking to the one you're looking for. The document you're looking for was marked as obsolete and not migrated to the new content management solution. Sure, your current content management system sucks, but it's still better than the one you're moving to. Nobody knows how git works; everybody simply rm -fr && git checkout's periodically. There are very few network restrictions creative and determined use of ssh(1) port forwarding can't overcome. This is both incredibly useful and concerning. It is tempting to jump right into implementing a solution when the right thing may well be to not do the thing that requires the solution in the first place. Turning things off permanently is surprisingly difficult . \" Ancient \" is a very relative term when it comes to software and protocols. \" Obsolete \" doesn't mean it's not in use and relied on. The sets of systems online before and after a data center power outage only intersect. Some of the old systems coming online will immediately cause a different outage. Some of your most critical services are kept alive by a handful of people whose job description does not mention those services at all. After the initial \"down for everybody or just me ermahgehrd Slack is down\" drop, productivity increases linearly throughout the duration of the outage. You're bound by the CAP theorem much more often than you may think. Halting Problem 's a bitch, too. Eventual consistency doesn't help when the system you're debugging hasn't converged yet. The source you're looking at is not the code running in production. strace(1)/ktrace(1) doesn't lie. Unless somebody's been playing LD_PRELOAD games. Schr\u00f6dinger's Backup -- \"The condition of any backup is unknown until a restore is attempted.\" -- is overly optimistic. There's an xkcd for the precise situation you find yourself in. (There's also one for at least half of these.) At some point in your career you will implement half of kerberos . Poorly. Any sufficiently successful product launch is indistinguishable from a DDoS; any sufficiently advanced user indistinguishable from an attacker. Debugging any sufficiently complex open source product is indistinguishable from reverse engineering a black box. \"We've always done it this way.\" is not a good reason by itself, but there's bound to be one for why. That reason may or may not be valid any longer, however. A junior engineer asking \"why\" and pointing out the docs don't reflect reality is at least as valuable as the senior engineer working blindly off tribal knowledge. Your herculean efforts to upgrade the OS across your entire fleet completed just in time for the EOL announcement of the version you upgraded to. This phenomenon was first described in Dante's Inferno as the Ninth Circle of Hell, Ring Four, aka RedHat Canto XXXIV. Containers create at least as many problems as they solve. The most ninja move the expert you hired for that third party black box product you rely on is to say \"Let me ping the support team\". Somewhere, somebody ran into this exact problem, but they never bothered to post a solution. That completely automated solution you set up requires at least three manual steps you didn't document. CAPEX budget always increases, OPEX budget always decreases. CAPEX costs can be reasonably estimated, OPEX costs can only be ballparked. Doubling your time estimate in the hopes of beating expectations won't work because your manager takes your estimate, has a hardy laugh, and then resets it back to what they already promised upchain. Your quarterly planning means bubkes when the next re-org rolls around. Most of your actual work is not covered by your OKRs . Recursively applying the Pareto Principle is a surprisingly accurate way to gauge your low hanging fruit, determine your high impact objectives, and ballpark your required effort. Although, to be honest, it only works in about 80% of cases . Management will always happily spend $$$ on outside consultants to tell them what you've been saying for years. Management will much rather invest in inventing a new, square wheel than fixing an old round one. In any organization practicing continuous integration , half of all commits are to fake out CI tests. Good software development practices do not always translate well to ops and friends. Mandatory code reviews do not automatically improve code quality nor reduce the frequency of incidents. Every new paradigm tends to mostly add layers of abstractions; cutting through them and identifying what basic principles continue to apply is half the battle. Real change can only be implemented above layer 7 . Prod is just another name for staging . Your source of truth lies. Also: it's incomplete. pcap or it didn't happen. grep(1) > Splunk (there, I said it) Multithreading is rarely worth the added complexity. Parallelism is not Concurrency. Simplicity is King . Nobody knows what exactly it is you do.","title":"operation lessons"},{"location":"devops/os/","text":"Operation systems with different level of Isolations General user with Security and Privacy # Debian Arch Linux Monjaro Arch Fork Anonymity Focused # QubeOS Whonix Tails Security Focused # QubeOS SELinux Pure OS Pentetsing Focused # Kali Linux Parrot Black Arch BackBox Pentoo Browsers # Authentic TurboNet","title":"os"},{"location":"devops/os/#general-user-with-security-and-privacy","text":"Debian Arch Linux Monjaro Arch Fork","title":"General user with Security and Privacy"},{"location":"devops/os/#anonymity-focused","text":"QubeOS Whonix Tails","title":"Anonymity Focused"},{"location":"devops/os/#security-focused","text":"QubeOS SELinux Pure OS","title":"Security Focused"},{"location":"devops/os/#pentetsing-focused","text":"Kali Linux Parrot Black Arch BackBox Pentoo","title":"Pentetsing Focused"},{"location":"devops/os/#browsers","text":"Authentic TurboNet","title":"Browsers"},{"location":"devops/architecture-notes/audits/","text":"Audit compliances # SOC2: compliance SOC2: staring OWASP: security verification standard CIS: compliance benchmarks CIS: cisesecryity tooling CIS: aws compliance","title":"audits documentation"},{"location":"devops/architecture-notes/audits/#audit-compliances","text":"SOC2: compliance SOC2: staring OWASP: security verification standard CIS: compliance benchmarks CIS: cisesecryity tooling CIS: aws compliance","title":"Audit compliances"},{"location":"devops/architecture-notes/design-data/","text":"data design The document contains information related to data design.

Ensure the release is based off of the release/ milestone branch Add a brief description for the release, followed by a changelog of issues organized by Artifact head (Eg Website, Designer, Templating, Renderer) and then further broken up by platforms where applicable For each feature breakdown, do include the links to the respective store download locations for the latest shipping versions ( See this for an example ) Ensure all issues and pull requests (where issues are not available) tagged \"AdaptiveCardsv \" are included in the changelog in long-form syntax with the full HTTP URL (and not github short-hand notation via # or # , except to call out Known Issues below) Include a Known Issues subsection with links to the issues in github short-hand notation ( not full HTTP URL)- This is a fabricbot \"ignore list\" quirk we are leveraging to avoid annotating issues that are linked in the release notes but not actually fixed.

NOTE: Each shipping artifact has its own versioning sequence (eg Templating SDK binaries should have their owning versioning scheme and not try to match the sequence of the renderer SDK binaries); Similarly, different platform implementations, esp ones that don't share a common code stack, may be expected to diverge even in their major versioning sequences from the other platform binaries, but our goal should be to keep these variances and releases in check and coordinate releases more broadly if and where possible. NOTE: AdaptiveCards Schema version number is yet another versioning metadata that has no bearing on the versioning of the released binaries/artifacts themselves (so for eg a 1.3 AdaptiveCards (schema) version may be implemented in Renderer versions 2.0.0 binaries/SDK) [WIP]Update the CHANGELOG.md in the main branch with key/relevant changes. (Tip: See changeloggenerator ) [WIP] Use git cherry-pick to add the new CHANGELOG entry to the release/<milestone> branch Visit the project's releases page (e.g. open https://github.com/microsoft/AdaptiveCards/releases ) Create a new release object for the git tag using the format <milestone> eg 2020.07 Ensure the title is of the format AdaptiveCards <milestone> eg AdaptiveCards 2020.07 ; Note: please adhere to these naming rules strictly to allow for post-processing of the generated release note (once published) by our bots for issue annotations with the release announce. Ensure the release is based off of the release/ milestone branch Add a brief description for the release, followed by a changelog of issues organized by Artifact head (Eg Website, Designer, Templating, Renderer) and then further broken up by platforms where applicable For each feature breakdown, do include the links to the respective store download locations for the latest shipping versions ( See this for an example ) Ensure all issues and pull requests (where issues are not available) tagged \"AdaptiveCardsv \" are included in the changelog in long-form syntax with the full HTTP URL (and not github short-hand notation via # or # , except to call out Known Issues below) Include a Known Issues subsection with links to the issues in github short-hand notation ( not full HTTP URL)- This is a fabricbot \"ignore list\" quirk we are leveraging to avoid annotating issues that are linked in the release notes but not actually fixed. Call out any Breaking Changes or Notable Bug Fixes based on the \"Breaking Changes\" etc label filters on the bugs Include a Smoke Testing Results section here with a pointer to our samples locations used for testing Repeat this process for servicing release/1.2 series.

Learn how to manage a data breach with the 6 phases in the incident response plan. # An incident response plan is a documented, written plan with 6 distinct phases that helps IT professionals and staff recognize and deal with a cybersecurity incident like a data breach or cyber attack. Properly creating and managing an incident response plan involves regular updates and training.

Within each phase, there are specific areas of need that should be considered. The incident response phases are: Preparation Identification Containment Eradication Recovery Lessons Learned Let\u2019s look at each phase in more depth and point out the items that you need to address. 1. Preparation # This phase will be the work horse of your incident response planning, and in the end, the most crucial phase to protect your business. Part of this phase includes: Ensure your employees are properly trained regarding their incident response roles and responsibilities in the event of data breach Develop incident response drill scenarios and regularly conduct mock data breaches to evaluate your incident response plan. Ensure that all aspects of your incident response plan (training, execution, hardware and software resources, etc.) are approved and funded in advance Your response plan should be well documented, thoroughly explaining everyone\u2019s roles and responsibilities. Then the plan must be tested in order to assure that your employees will perform as they were trained. The more prepared your employees are, the less likely they\u2019ll make critical mistakes. Questions to address Has everyone been trained on security policies? Have your security policies and incident response plan been approved by appropriate management? Does the Incident Response Team know their roles and the required notifications to make? Have all Incident Response Team members participated in mock drills? SEE ALSO: 5 Things Your Incident Response Plan Needs 2. Identification # This is the process where you determine whether you\u2019ve been breached. A breach, or incident, could originate from many different areas. Questions to address When did the event happen? How was it discovered? Who discovered it? Have any other areas been impacted? What is the scope of the compromise? Does it affect operations? Has the source (point of entry) of the event been discovered? 3. Containment # When a breach is first discovered, your initial instinct may be to securely delete everything so you can just get rid of it. However, that will likely hurt you in the long run since you\u2019ll be destroying valuable evidence that you need to determine where the breach started and devise a plan to prevent it from happening again. Instead, contain the breach so it doesn\u2019t spread and cause further damage to your business. If you can, disconnect affected devices from the Internet. Have short-term and long-term containment strategies ready. It\u2019s also good to have a redundant system back-up to help restore business operations. That way, any compromised data isn\u2019t lost forever. This is also a good time to update and patch your systems, review your remote access protocols (requiring mandatory multi-factor authentication ), change all user and administrative access credentials and harden all passwords. WATCH: Forensics Lessons Learned Webinar Questions to address What\u2019s been done to contain the breach short term? What\u2019s been done to contain the breach long term? Has any discovered malware been quarantined from the rest of the environment? What sort of backups are in place? Does your remote access require true multi-factor authentication? Have all access credentials been reviewed for legitimacy, hardened and changed? Have you applied all recent security patches and updates? SEE ALSO: Forensic Research: Data Breach Trends 4. Eradication # Once you\u2019ve contained the issue, you need to find and eliminate the root cause of the breach. This means all malware should be securely removed, systems should again be hardened and patched, and updates should be applied. Whether you do this yourself, or hire a third party to do it, you need to be thorough. If any trace of malware or security issues remain in your systems, you may still be losing valuable data, and your liability could increase. Questions to address Have artifacts/malware from the attacker been securely removed? Has the system be hardened, patched, and updates applied? Can the system be re-imaged? 5. Recovery # This is the process of restoring and returning affected systems and devices back into your business environment. During this time, it\u2019s important to get your systems and business operations up and running again without the fear of another breach. Questions to address When can systems be returned to production? Have systems been patched, hardened and tested? Can the system be restored from a trusted back-up? How long will the affected systems be monitored and what will you look for when monitoring? What tools will ensure similar attacks will not reoccur? (File integrity monitoring, intrusion detection/protection, etc) 6. Lessons Learned # Once the investigation is complete, hold an after-action meeting with all Incident Response Team members and discuss what you\u2019ve learned from the data breach. This is where you will analyze and document everything about the breach. Determine what worked well in your response plan, and where there were some holes. Lessons learned from both mock and real events will help strengthen your systems against the future attacks. Questions to address What changes need to be made to the security? How should employee be trained differently? What weakness did the breach exploit? How will you ensure a similar breach doesn\u2019t happen again? No one wants to go through a data breach, but it\u2019s essential to plan for one. Prepare for it, know what to do when it happens, and learn all that you can afterwards.","title":"Incident Readiness Phases"},{"location":"devops/check-lists/incident-response-phases/#what-is-an-incident-response-plan-for-cyber-security-learn-how-to-manage-a-data-breach-with-the-6-phases-in-the-incident-response-plan","text":"An incident response plan is a documented, written plan with 6 distinct phases that helps IT professionals and staff recognize and deal with a cybersecurity incident like a data breach or cyber attack.

However, that will likely hurt you in the long run since you\u2019ll be destroying valuable evidence that you need to determine where the breach started and devise a plan to prevent it from happening again. Instead, contain the breach so it doesn\u2019t spread and cause further damage to your business. If you can, disconnect affected devices from the Internet. Have short-term and long-term containment strategies ready. It\u2019s also good to have a redundant system back-up to help restore business operations. That way, any compromised data isn\u2019t lost forever. This is also a good time to update and patch your systems, review your remote access protocols (requiring mandatory multi-factor authentication ), change all user and administrative access credentials and harden all passwords.

Logging in code Modern programming languages come with logging packages that allow you to add lines of text to a log file as the application is running. Taking advantage of these packages will give you a papertrail of what your application is doing as users interact with it. Smart use of logging will allow you to spot bugs in your code, diagnose incorrect behavior in your application, troubleshoot user issuers, and raise alerts when cyber-attacks occur. Key Elements in Log Statements Each entry written to a log file should contain a timestamp, the log message, and an indication of where in the code the entry is being written from - in other words, the code file and line number. Depending on what type of functionality the code is handling, it is also useful to include some of the following: The server name if more than one server is writing to the log file. The URL, HTTP status code and incoming IP address if the code is handling an incoming HTTP request. The username if the code is being executed in response to an action by a logged-in user. Timing information if the code is executing a time-sensitive action. Diagnostic information - for instance, if any action had to re-tried, or if a component is responding slowly. Error messages and stack traces if an error occurs. What Events to Log You should log every HTTP request and the corresponding response, being sure to include the URL, the HTTP response code, and the time taken to service the request. You should also log any significant actions performed by your web application, including: Input validation failures, e.g. when the code encounters unexpected parameter names or values. Authentication successes and failures. Authorization (access control) failures. Session management failures, e.g. when session cookies are rejected as invalid. Application errors and system events. Startup and shutdown events - including timing information! User events like sign-ups, password changes and account deletions. Administrative events, e.g. when permissions are changed by an admin. Calls to third-party services or APIs. Legal and other opt-ins, e.g. when a user accepts the terms of use. Log Levels By convention, most logging packages allow you to mark logging statements with one of at least four \u201clog levels\u201d - typically named DEBUG, INFO, WARNING and ERROR, in order of importance. You should mark each logging statement with an appropriate log level to make it easy to filter out the noise in log files. Servers can be configured so only statements marked with a particular log level are written to the log file: a server configured with the INFO log-level will write INFO, WARNING and ERROR messages to the log file, but omit DEBUG messages. Low-level diagnostic events should be marked as DEBUG statements, and typically only show up in non-production environments. The INFO log level should be used for normal running: the events expected to occur when users interact with your website. Unexpected events should be logged with the WARNING level, and errors should be marked with the ERROR log level. Make sure your team has access to these logs too when diagnosing issues. In addition to the logging statements added to your code, other applications in your stack will typically output log files. A web server like Apache, Nginx or IIS will log HTTP request and response information. Databases will typically write log files too, which are useful for diagnosing performance issues. log aggregation and storage Logs should be centralized and stored securely so they can be viewed by administrators. \u201cLog servers\u201d like LogStash, Graylog, Splunk and PaperTrail will aggregate log files from different sources and allow them to be searched and analyzed in realtime. Log servers are often available as services, and can be added as plug-ins if you run on cloud-based services. monitoring is paired with logging The process of continuously assessing whether your site is running as expected. Monitoring software often pulls key \u201cmetrics\u201d from log files to diagnose the health of a web application. Let\u2019s discuss the various ways you can monitor your application. Uptime Monitoring is in place The most basic form of monitoring is checking that your site is available. \u201cUptime monitors\u201d like Uptime Robot and Pingdom are free services that will check whether a URL is responding to HTTP requests successfully. (More complex or frequent checks are usually available as a paid option.) This is a simple way to achieve peace-of-mind: if your site ever becomes unavailable, the monitoring software will send an email or text alert to your team. Error Reporting Capturing unexpected errors that occur on your website is key to detecting cyber-attacks and ensuring software quality. Errors conditions can either be extracted from log files, or recorded using plug-ins provided by services like Rollbar or Airbrake. Error reporting services even allow you to capture error conditions that occur in JavaScript in the browser, which typically won\u2019t appear in server-side logs. Performance Metrics Capturing performance metrics will give you granular information about the state of your web application. Your monitoring should keep track of: Responsiveness: how long it takes to respond to each web request. Throughput: how many requests per second are hitting your site. Memory usage and server load: how much of each server\u2019s memory space is being used up, and how close each server is to full capacity. Database performance: how many queries are being run per second and how many concurrent connections there are. Alerting You should configure your monitoring software to alert your team when unusual errors occur or when performance metrics reach critical conditions. Alerts can be sent over email, instant messaging or text. Large organizations will have support rotas, so at least one engineer is available to respond to alerts at all times. Response Plans Being alerted to errors is only useful if there are actions your support engineers can undertake to fix the error condition! Make sure you put together a trouble-shooting plan for a responding engineer to follow, and keep it up to date as you develop your system. Troubleshooting steps may consist of restarting servers, adding extra servers in times of high load, blacklisting IP addresses when you see malicious traffic, or escalating to team specialists (like network engineers and database administrators) when particular parts of the application appear to be the problem. If the issue starts to affect users, making an announcement on a status page or in a website banner will earn you goodwill. What Not to Log Writing sensitive information to your logs is a security risk - imagine what an attacker could do if they stole your log files! Make sure your logging statements never contain any of the following: User or system passwords. Encryption keys. Database connection strings. API keys for third-party services. Personally identifiable information about users. Payment information like credit card numbers. Sensitive HTTP headers, such as Authorization headers. Session IDs or session cookies. Access tokens - for example, those used during sign-ups or password resets. Information a user has opted out of collection.

A deployment architecture diagram consists of network boundaries and infrastructure hardware/software components. The size and quantity of the components are also sometimes specified in order to facilitate planning. Use Case # A common use of this diagram is to facilitate the upgrading of applications and services to handle the additional load or the optimisation of resources. Over time, as more users from various parts of the world start using your applications and services, your existing resources may not be able to handle the increased scale and load.

A DevOps architecture diagram often comprises of system components, processes, and environments. The diagram resembles a process flow diagram illustrating the operations to ship a codebase/app to production Use Case # A common use of this diagram is to facilitate the improvement of processes with regards to app deployments. The constant changes to systems architecture and improvements to deployment tools/methods, e.g. Containers, Serverless, etc. prompts a need to adapt existing DevOps architecture and processes to keep up with the times. Questions to Address # What\u2019s the current process flow? How are configurations currently managed across applications? What are the types of applications to be deployed? Useful components in this diagram # Showcase processes across environments \u2014 DevOps usually span across environments, and it\u2019s often useful to show the applications promotion processes. Annotations with additional information \u2014 further details for the respective stages and processes can be included to facilitate discussions and planning. Decision gateways and user processes \u2014 DevOps don\u2019t only include system components and involves a large part of the human element to build a good DevOps culture; the human processes component cannot be ignored. Data Architecture Diagram # Data architecture diagram showcases the flow of data across system components within an IT infrastructure and indicates how data is collected, processed, stored, and used to facilitate data systems optimisation. A data architecture diagram contains components within a system that define how data is collected, processed, stored, and used. The diagram also illustrates the flow of data across system components within the IT infrastructure. Use Case # One of the use cases of this diagram is to facilitate the upgrading of resources to optimise data collection and storage costs. With the increasing amount of data captured today and the cost of data storage getting cheaper, there are bound to be constant adjustments to the data architecture for organisations. Questions to Address # How is data being processed currently? Where is the data being stored and used? How much data are we talking about?

Compute Abstractions Diagram # I was trying to find a way to explain, in the easiest way possible, all the options the platform offers to our users from a compute perspective. There are of course many ways to peal this onion and I wanted to create a \u201cvisual story\u201d that was easy for me to tell. The compute domain as \"anything that has CPU and Memory capacity that allows you to run an arbitrary piece of code written in a specific programming language\". It goes without saying that your mileage may vary in how you define it but this is a broad enough definition that should cover a lot of different interpretations. Use Case # The reason for which the line above is oblique, is because it needs to intercept different compute abstraction levels. If you think about what happened in the last 20 years of IT, we have seen a surge of different compute abstractions that have changed the way people consume CPU and Memory resources. It all started with physical (x86) servers back in the eighties and then we have seen the industry adding a number of abstraction layers over the years (i.e. hypervisors, containers, functions). As you can depict from the graphic below, the higher you go in the abstraction levels, the more the cloud provider can add value and can offload the consumer from non-strategic activities. A lot of these activities tend to be \u201cundifferentiated heavy lifting\u201d. Questions to Address # Some customers were (and still are) happy about being in full control of said instances. Are you one of them? Useful components in this diagram # The bare metal abstraction - Also known as the \u201cno abstraction\u201d. The instance (or virtual machine) abstraction - (Amazon EC2) is the service that allows AWS customers to launch instances in the cloud. When customers intercept the platform at this level, they retain responsibility of the guest Operating System and above (middleware, applications etc.) and their life-cycle. Similarly, customers leave to AWS the responsibility for managing the hardware and the hypervisor including their life-cycle. The container abstraction - In a nutshell, you can think of a container as a self-contained environment with soft boundaries that includes both your own application as well as the software dependencies to run it. Whereas an instance (or VM) virtualizes a piece of hardware so that you can run dedicated operating systems, a container technology virtualizes an operating system so that you can run separated applications with different (and often incompatible) software dependencies. The full container abstraction (for lack of a better term) - Practically speaking, Fargate is making the containers data plane fall into the \"Provider space\" responsibility. This means the compute unit exposed to the user is the container abstraction, while AWS will manage transparently the data plane abstractions underneath. The function abstraction - In the context of this blog post, the key point about Lambda is that you don\u2019t have to manage the infrastructure underneath the function you are running. No need to track the status of the physical hosts, no need to track the capacity of the fleet, no need to patch the OS where the function will be running. In a nutshell, no need to spend time and money on the undifferentiated heavy lifting.","title":"Application Readiness checklist"},{"location":"devops/check-lists/technical-diagrams-checklist/#technical-architecture-diagrams","text":"A technical architecture diagram provides a bird\u2019s eye view of the infrastructure of your organisation.

martym, agoogler Status : Complete, action items in progress Summary : Shakespeare Search down for 66 minutes during period of very high interest in Shakespeare due to discovery of a new sonnet. Impact : 163 Estimated 1.21B queries lost, no revenue impact. Root Causes : 164 Cascading failure due to combination of exceptionally high load and a resource leak when searches failed due to terms not being in the Shakespeare corpus. The newly discovered sonnet used a word that had never before appeared in one of Shakespeare\u2019s works, which happened to be the term users searched for. Under normal circumstances, the rate of task failures due to resource leaks is low enough to be unnoticed. Trigger : Latent bug triggered by sudden increase in traffic. Resolution : Directed traffic to sacrificial cluster and added 10x capacity to mitigate cascading failure. Updated index deployed, resolving interaction with latent bug. Maintaining extra capacity until surge in public interest in new sonnet passes. Resource leak identified and fix deployed. Detection : Borgmon detected high level of HTTP 500s and paged on-call.

Generating a new runbooks image # To generate a new image you must follow the git commit guidelines below, this will trigger a semantic version bump which will then cause a new pipeline that will build and tag the new image Git Commit Guidelines # This project uses Semantic Versioning . We use commit messages to automatically determine the version bumps, so they should adhere to the conventions of Conventional Commits (v1.0.0-beta.2) . TL;DR # Commit messages starting with fix: trigger a patch version bump Commit messages starting with feat: trigger a minor version bump Commit messages starting with BREAKING CHANGE: trigger a major version bump. If you don't want to publish a new image, do not use the above starting strings. Automatic versioning # Each push to master triggers a semantic-release CI job that determines and pushes a new version tag (if any) based on the last version tagged and the new commits pushed. Notice that this means that if a Merge Request contains, for example, several feat: commits, only one minor version bump will occur on merge. If your Merge Request includes several commits you may prefer to ignore the prefix on each individual commit and instead add an empty commit summarizing your changes like so: git commit --allow-empty -m '[BREAKING CHANGE|feat|fix]: <changelog summary message>' Tool Versioning # This project has adopted adsf version-manager for tool versioning. Installation instructions for asdf can be found at https://asdf-vm.com/#/core-manage-asdf-vm?id=install . For compatibility, please configure the following line in ~/.asdfrc legacy_version_file = yes Dependencies and required tooling # Following tools and libraries are required to develop dashboards locally: Go programming langugage Ruby programming language go-jsonnet - Jsonnet implementation written in Go jsonnet-bunder - package manager for Jsonnet jq - command line JSON processor You can install most of them using asdf tool. Manage your dependencies using asdf # Our asdf toolset uses the following plugins: golang : asdf plugin add golang ruby : asdf plugin add ruby go-jsonnet : asdf plugin add go-jsonnet . jsonnet-bundler : asdf plugin add jb . Once you have installed these plugins, run the following command to install the required versions. $ asdf install go-jsonnet 0.16.0 is already installed golang 1.14 is already installed ruby 2.6.5 is already installed $ # Confirm everything is working with.... $ asdf current go-jsonnet 0.16.0 (set by ~/runbooks/.tool-versions) golang 1.14 (set by ~/runbooks/.tool-versions) ruby 2.6.5 (set by ~/runbooks/.ruby-version) You don't need to use asdf , but in such case you will need install all dependencies manually and track their versions. Go, Jsonnet # We use .tool-versions to record the version of go-jsonnet that should be used for local development. The asdf version manager is used by some team members to automatically switch versions based on the contents of this file. It should be kept up to date. The top-level Dockerfile contains the version of go-jsonnet we use in CI. This should be kept in sync with .tool-versions , and a (non-gating) CI job enforces this. To install go-jsonnet , you have a few options. You could follow that project's README to install manually; Or via homebrew: brew install go-jsonnet Or if you're using asdf , you can use an asdf plugin . Ruby # Additional to adsf , many developers use rbenv , rvm or other tooling, so, for convenience, we maintain the standard .ruby-version file for the Ruby version. ASDF needs to be configured using the legacy_version_file = yes setting described in the parent section .

Make your job easier and don\u2019t. It\u2019s terribly difficult to manage unmotivated people. Make your job easier and don\u2019t. Different people need different kinds of management. Be adaptable to figure out what drives each person\u2019s best performance. Give feedback frequently and directly. As a manager, it\u2019s easier to wait and then hedge critical feedback in soft wrappers, but that\u2019s selfish. I\u2019d try to give feedback as soon as I could grab a conference room with the person, and not wait until the formal 1:1 days later. A-players love hearing critical feedback about how they\u2019re performing, and they hate when B-players don\u2019t hear feedback of their own. Keep your A-players happy by providing actionable feedback to everyone and recognizing superior performance. Communication is the most difficult thing you\u2019ll do. Spend a lot of time on it, both on your own communication and improving the communication of the folks on your team. Fire quickly. If you don\u2019t fire bad performers fast, you\u2019re at risk of losing your good performers. Don\u2019t underestimate the effect bad performers have on good performers. Your team will likely move faster even with fewer bodies. Finally, firing for bad performance is easier than having to fire good people because you\u2019ve run out of money, so fire the bad people before you have to fire the good people too. People need to feel like they\u2019ve been listened to, not to make the final call. Take the time to listen (you might be wrong), make a decision and then explain the decision. Don\u2019t offer commentary on others\u2019 decisions until you understand why the decisions were made. Providing context for why you made a decision is a way to scale your decision-making process. The goal is for the manager to make as few decisions as possible, and to do this, your team needs to understand how to make good decisions. Define success clearly and don\u2019t flip-flop on the definition without new information. On the other hand, when the facts change, re-evaluate your goals. Set achievable but difficult targets. Hiring friends can be very useful because communication will be easier, and your friends are probably smart and talented. But you might do so at the cost of hiring for things like experience or domain-expertise. If you can\u2019t fire friends, don\u2019t hire them. Mission-oriented teams are a competitive advantage because they make it easier to 1) hire and 2) motivate. Any action taken between a manager and an individual (a promotion, more frequent 1:1's, a call out in a meeting) is not just between the manager and the individual, but affects every person on the team. For example, if you promote one person, make sure the rest of the team understands why that person was promoted and what needs to be done to achieve the same. You\u2019re more likely to lose by not recognizing your weaknesses than from the presence of weakness, so aim for self-awareness. Sometimes you\u2019ll have to bet on big, resource intensive projects that won\u2019t work. Be careful of the morale toll on your team. Not everyone has great tolerance for repeated failure. If you\u2019re a founder, you probably are more used to this than your team. One technique is to mix iterative work with riskier bigger bets to rebuild this energy. But you should also try to not paint any feature as a silver bullet, and individual failure in good faith as a necessary cost of trying new things. Your company is a portfolio bet. How you spend money is one of the biggest cultural signals you can send and is very hard to change. Where you spend money (and where you don\u2019t) communicates what you think is important. The best way to avoid politics isn\u2019t to ignore politics, but to spend your time on it. Define clear merit-based systems, which reduces confusion about what your team members need to do be recognized. One of the most helpful things you can do is remind the team of the bigger picture. Knowing what\u2019s important will help cut through the bullshit. The best way to manage great people is to provide clarity of purpose and regular feedback (which is different than regular direction). While career development is ultimately the responsibility of each individual (who else?), time spent as a manager to proactively understand and enable growth is time-well spent. Sometimes people talk shit. Sometimes people have bad days. Don\u2019t take either personally. A personal mantra I\u2019ve found useful is \u201cwe were lucky but now is the time to be good.\u201d That is to say, let us pretend that all past success was the result of our situation and not our own hard work or good qualities. We now have a unique opportunity to reduce our dependence on luck through superior performance. There is no cost to this belief except your ego, and it can help drive radical self and team improvement.","title":"21 people management tips"},{"location":"management/people/21-management-tips/#21-management-things-i-learned-at-imgur-by-sam-gerstenzang-medium","text":"","title":"21 management things I learned at Imgur | by Sam Gerstenzang | Medium"},{"location":"management/people/21-management-tips/#excerpt","text":"It\u2019s terribly difficult to manage unmotivated people.

That being said, there's a number of excellent books, listed below. Turn the Ship Around!: A True Story of Turning Followers into Leaders # \ud83d\udcd6 Turn the Ship Around!: A True Story of Turning Followers into Leaders is hands down my preferred management book. This book made me truly understand what empowering local decision means. In particular, I liked how the author explains that the usual chain of command requires information to go up the chain, and decision to go down, which is insanely inefficient. It provides great tools for managers to help their team members come up with their own decisions, in particular the notion of deliberate action . There's a also a presentation that talks about the main concepts the author developed. There are numerous cheesy management books and this is not one of them. The narration is great as well and the explanations are short, and to the point. You can find a short summary in video here \u201cControl without competence is chaos.\u201d \u2014 L. David Marquet, Turn the Ship Around! Other generalist books # \ud83d\udcd6 The Advantage, Enhanced Edition: Why Organizational Health Trumps Everything Else In Business , Patrick M. Lencioni. The only way for people to embrace a message is to hear it over a period of time, in a variety of different situations, and preferably from different people. That\u2019s why great leaders see themselves as Chief Reminding Officers as much as anything else. The best way to do cascading communication is face-to-face and live. Seeing a leader and hearing the tone of his or her voice is critical for employees, as is being able to ask a question or two. But then again, most organizations are unhealthy precisely because they aren\u2019t doing the basic things, which require discipline, persistence, and follow-through more than sophistication or intelligence. \ud83d\udcd6 Managing Humans: Biting and Humorous Tales of a Software Engineering Manager : \"Read hilarious stories with serious lessons that Michael Lopp extracts from his varied and sometimes bizarre experiences as a manager at Apple, Pinterest, Palantir, Netscape, Symantec, Slack, and Borland. Many of the stories first appeared in primitive form in Lopp\u2019s perennially popular blog, Rands in Repose.\" \ud83d\udcd6 Oren Ellenbogen, Leading Snowflakes: the Engineering Manager Handbook : some truly great content and concrete ideas to move from maker to manager mode, code reviewing your management decisions, delegating tasks without losing quality or visibility. \ud83d\udcd6 Adam Grant, Give and Take: Why Helping Others Drives Our Success : \"This gem is a joy to read, and it shatters the myth that greed is the path to success.\", Robert Sutton. \ud83d\udcd6 Ken Blanchard, Lead Like Jesus: Lessons from the Greatest Leadership Role Model of All Time . \ud83d\udcd6 Andrew S. Grove, High Output Management . A landmark book by Intel CEO Andy Grove. Introduced many of the management best practices such as 1-1, OKR. Managerial leverage measures the impact of what managers do to increase the output of their teams. You need to plan the way a fire department plans. It cannot anticipate where the next fire will be, so it has to shape an energetic and efficient team that is capable of responding to the unanticipated as well as to any ordinary event. Every hour of your day should be spent increasing the output or the value of the output of the people whom you\u2019re responsible for. A common rule we should always try to heed is to detect and fix any problem in a production process at the lowest-value stage possible. A genuinely effective indicator will cover the output of the work unit and not simply the activity involved. Obviously, you measure a salesman by the orders he gets (output), not by the calls he makes (activity). A manager\u2019s output = The output of his organization + The output of the neighboring organizations under his influence. League standings are kept by team, not by individual. Business\u2014and this means not just the business of commerce but the business of education, the business of government, the business of medicine\u2014is a team activity. And, always, it takes a team to win. Your decision-making depends finally on how well you comprehend the facts and issues facing your business. This is why information-gathering is so important in a manager\u2019s life. The lack of a decision is the same as a negative decision; no green light is a red light, and work can stop for a whole organization. Delegation without follow-through is abdication. Any decision be worked out and reached at the lowest competent level. The reason is that this is where it will be made by people who are closest to the situation and know the most about it. Self-confidence mostly comes from a gut-level realization that nobody has ever died from making a wrong business decision, or taking inappropriate action, or being overruled. A successful MBO [management by objective] system needs only to answer two questions: 1. Where do I want to go? (The answer provides the objective.) 2. How will I pace myself to see if I am getting there? (The answer gives us milestones, or key results). The one thing an MBO system should provide par excellence is focus. This can only happen if we keep the number of objectives small. In practice, this is rare, and here, as elsewhere, we fall victim to our inability to say \u201cno\u201d\u2014in this case, to too many objectives. We must realize\u2014and act on the realization\u2014that if we try to focus on everything, we focus on nothing. A few extremely well-chosen objectives impart a clear message about what we say \u201cyes\u201d to and what we say \u201cno\u201d to\u2014which is what we must have if an MBO system is to work. Alfred Sloan summed up decades of experience at General Motors by saying, \u201cGood management rests on a reconciliation of centralization and decentralization.\u201d Or, we might say, on a balancing act to get the best combination of responsiveness and leverage. I would like to propose Grove\u2019s Law: All large organizations with a common business purpose end up in a hybrid organizational form. When a person is not doing his job, there can only be two reasons for it. The person either can\u2019t do it or won\u2019t do it; he is either not capable or not motivated. That variable is the task-relevant maturity (TRM) of the subordinates, which is a combination of the degree of their achievement orientation and readiness to take responsibility, as well as their education, training, and experience. When the TRM is low, the most effective approach is one that offers very precise and detailed instructions, wherein the supervisor tells the subordinate what needs to be done, when, and how: in other words, a highly structured approach. As the TRM of the subordinate grows, the most effective style moves from the structured to one more given to communication, emotional support, and encouragement. The responsibility for teaching the subordinate must be assumed by his supervisor, and not paid for by the customers of his organization, internal or external. At all times you should force yourself to assess performance, not potential. A manager generally has two ways to raise the level of individual performance of his subordinates: by increasing motivation, the desire of each person to do his job well, and by increasing individual capability, which is where training comes in. \ud83d\udcd6 Patrick Lencioni, The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A Leadership Fable . \ud83d\udcd6 Work Rules!: Insights from Inside Google That Will Transform How You Live and Lead, Laszlo Bock.

Vulnerability Cultivates Trust Hiring # General # \ud83d\udcd6 Hiring The Best Knowledge Workers, Techies & Nerds: The Secrets & Science Of Hiring Technical People , Johanna Rothman. A solution-oriented book. Train your interview team to apply a limited-consensus approach to hiring. When groups use limited consensus, not everyone may agree with the decision, but each person should be satisfied enough with a particular candidate\u2019s suitability not to block the decision to hire him or her. What if the vetoer is someone I don\u2019t want to keep in the organization?\u201d The answer to this is simple: In the interview process, only involve employees whose work you respect and value. If an employee isn\u2019t successful in his or her technical position, don\u2019t make that employee part of the interview team. Make sure members of your team interview an internal candidate the same way they would interview an external candidate. Know why you\u2019re hiring more people. Define your problems to define your hiring strategy. Sometimes, the main reason a hiring manager doesn\u2019t hire a candidate is that he or she has a gut feeling that the person just won\u2019t fit well with the culture. But a \u201cgut feeling\u201d is not a good reason not to hire someone, so train yourself to articulate culture-fit differences. I personally do not consider certification to mean anything much when I am hiring someone for a technical position. Because the knowledge tested is functional-skills book knowledge, make sure you understand what the person must do to maintain his or her certification and the value of that certification to your environment. Too often, internal recruiters look for tool and technology expertise or for advanced academic degrees, rather than for functional skill or for product-domain experience. If you feel the need to take notes, take them on paper, never on a computer. My reason for this is that when you use a computer, you have to sit behind a screen, which creates a barrier between you and the candidate. Promising an unconditional promotion is not just risky; it is stupid. Circumstances within the company can change; the employee may not perform up to expectations; the economy may tank.

Your first responsibility as a manager is to manage yourself: your integrity, character, ethics, knowledge, wisdom, temperament, words and acts. The second responsibility is to manage those who have authority over us. The third responsibility is to manage your peers: without their respect and confidence, nothing can be accomplished. The fourth responsibility is to manage those whom we have authority. You can't manage your bosses, peers, regulators etc. But you can understand them, motivate them, influence them, forgive them. \"It is from failure that amazing growth and grace so often come, provided only that one can recognise it, admit it, learn from it, rise above it, and try again. True leadership presumes a standard quite beyond human perfectibility and that is quite alright, for joy and satisfaction are in the pursuit of an objective, not in its realization.\" Quote: \"If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people to collect wood and don't assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea.\", Antoine de Saint-Exupery \"Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things.\", Peter Drucker Meetings # On Better Meetings : Lara Hogan shares tips about ensuring efficient meetings. \ud83c\udf9e Almost Live! - Middle Management Suck-Ups : a great example of a terrible ineffective meeting.

Good managers address context first, then content. Good managers know that, above all else, they are agents of their company. Their default mode is to make and facilitate company-optimal choices. Good managers know that fixing broader company culture is an important part of their role as a designated leader within the company. Good managers understand that the long game is all about people.

Onboarding new team members # \ud83c\udf9e 5 Onboarding Fiascos From the Movies Organization structure # Martin Casado, Hire a VP of Engineering on the Andreessen Horowitz blog The most important function of a VP of engineering is to build out the engineering team and set a startup\u2019s engineering culture. Competent engineering management should therefore be able to push the team towards more practical, incremental designs that can garner useful external feedback quickly \u2014 without compromising the long-term generality of the system. The VP\u2019s role here is not producing the architecture, but ensuring that incremental release is a real requirement in the design process. Strong engineering management tends to give their teams enough ownership and latitude that they are happy and fulfilled in driving the product forward. AVC, VP Engineering Vs CTO Mark Suster, Want to Know the Difference Between a CTO and a VP Engineering? \ud83c\udfa4 CTO vs VP Engineering Balancing Innovation , Bryan Cantrill, Jason Hoffman Spotify\u2019s Failed #SquadGoals Engineering managers in this model had little responsibility beyond the career development of the people they managed. There was no single person accountable for the engineering team\u2019s delivery or who could negotiate prioritization of work at an equivalent level of responsibility. Autonomy requires alignment. Company priorities must be defined by leadership. Autonomy does not mean teams get to do whatever they want. Business units, departments, teams, and managers more effectively communicate organization structure roles and responsibilities than Spotify\u2019s synonyms and are not attached to a way of working that failed their creator. Independence,autonomy,too many small teams Every autonomous team is expected to generate direct business value all by itself, without a lot of overlap with other teams. The team should be able to meets its goals independently (i.e. without reliance on or interference from other teams). Coordination, also known as alignment, communication, shared roadmap, Gantt chart and many other positive sounding names, is the arch-enemy of the autonomous team. Production and productivity # The Toyota Way , Wikipedia Base your management decisions on a long-term philosophy, even at the expense of short-term financial goals. Create a continuous process flow to bring problems to the surface. Use \"pull\" systems to avoid overproduction. Level out the workload Build a culture of stopping to fix problems, to get quality right the first time Standardized tasks and processes are the foundation for continuous improvement and employee empowerment. Use visual control so no problems are hidden. Use only reliable, thoroughly tested technology that serves your people and processes. Grow leaders who thoroughly understand the work, live the philosophy, and teach it to others. Develop exceptional people and teams who follow your company's philosophy. Respect your extended network of partners and suppliers by challenging them and helping them improve.

Now I do not think software managers have less inherent courage and firmness than chefs, nor than other engineering managers. But false scheduling to match the patron's desired date is much more common in our discipline than elsewhere in engineering. The boss must first distinguish between action information and status information. He must discipline himself not to act on problems his managers can solve.

Can Do Vs Must Do , AVC. \"Doing a startup is like playing a video game. Each level requires you to master one thing and once you do that, you level up and then there is a new thing to master.\" \"Waterline principle\" from Bill Gore: \"Think of being on a ship, and imagine that any decision gone bad will blow a hole in the side of the ship. If you blow a hole above the waterline (where the ship won\u2019t take on water and possibly sink), you can patch the hole, learn from the experience, and sail on. But if you blow a hole below the waterline, you can find yourself facing gushers of water pouring in, pulling you toward the ocean floor. And if it\u2019s a big enough hole, you might go down really fast, just like some of the financial firm catastrophes of 2008. To be clear, great enterprises do make big bets, but they avoid big bets that could blow holes below the waterline.\", How We Might Fall.

That\u2019s why great leaders see themselves as Chief Reminding Officers as much as anything else. The best way to do cascading communication is face-to-face and live. Seeing a leader and hearing the tone of his or her voice is critical for employees, as is being able to ask a question or two. But then again, most organizations are unhealthy precisely because they aren\u2019t doing the basic things, which require discipline, persistence, and follow-through more than sophistication or intelligence. \ud83d\udcd6 Managing Humans: Biting and Humorous Tales of a Software Engineering Manager : \"Read hilarious stories with serious lessons that Michael Lopp extracts from his varied and sometimes bizarre experiences as a manager at Apple, Pinterest, Palantir, Netscape, Symantec, Slack, and Borland.

Grove, High Output Management . A landmark book by Intel CEO Andy Grove. Introduced many of the management best practices such as 1-1, OKR. Managerial leverage measures the impact of what managers do to increase the output of their teams. You need to plan the way a fire department plans. It cannot anticipate where the next fire will be, so it has to shape an energetic and efficient team that is capable of responding to the unanticipated as well as to any ordinary event. Every hour of your day should be spent increasing the output or the value of the output of the people whom you\u2019re responsible for. A common rule we should always try to heed is to detect and fix any problem in a production process at the lowest-value stage possible. A genuinely effective indicator will cover the output of the work unit and not simply the activity involved. Obviously, you measure a salesman by the orders he gets (output), not by the calls he makes (activity). A manager\u2019s output = The output of his organization + The output of the neighboring organizations under his influence. League standings are kept by team, not by individual. Business\u2014and this means not just the business of commerce but the business of education, the business of government, the business of medicine\u2014is a team activity. And, always, it takes a team to win. Your decision-making depends finally on how well you comprehend the facts and issues facing your business. This is why information-gathering is so important in a manager\u2019s life. The lack of a decision is the same as a negative decision; no green light is a red light, and work can stop for a whole organization. Delegation without follow-through is abdication. Any decision be worked out and reached at the lowest competent level. The reason is that this is where it will be made by people who are closest to the situation and know the most about it. Self-confidence mostly comes from a gut-level realization that nobody has ever died from making a wrong business decision, or taking inappropriate action, or being overruled. A successful MBO [management by objective] system needs only to answer two questions: 1. Where do I want to go? (The answer provides the objective.) 2. How will I pace myself to see if I am getting there? (The answer gives us milestones, or key results). The one thing an MBO system should provide par excellence is focus. This can only happen if we keep the number of objectives small. In practice, this is rare, and here, as elsewhere, we fall victim to our inability to say \u201cno\u201d\u2014in this case, to too many objectives. We must realize\u2014and act on the realization\u2014that if we try to focus on everything, we focus on nothing. A few extremely well-chosen objectives impart a clear message about what we say \u201cyes\u201d to and what we say \u201cno\u201d to\u2014which is what we must have if an MBO system is to work. Alfred Sloan summed up decades of experience at General Motors by saying, \u201cGood management rests on a reconciliation of centralization and decentralization.\u201d Or, we might say, on a balancing act to get the best combination of responsiveness and leverage. I would like to propose Grove\u2019s Law: All large organizations with a common business purpose end up in a hybrid organizational form. When a person is not doing his job, there can only be two reasons for it. The person either can\u2019t do it or won\u2019t do it; he is either not capable or not motivated. That variable is the task-relevant maturity (TRM) of the subordinates, which is a combination of the degree of their achievement orientation and readiness to take responsibility, as well as their education, training, and experience. When the TRM is low, the most effective approach is one that offers very precise and detailed instructions, wherein the supervisor tells the subordinate what needs to be done, when, and how: in other words, a highly structured approach. As the TRM of the subordinate grows, the most effective style moves from the structured to one more given to communication, emotional support, and encouragement. The responsibility for teaching the subordinate must be assumed by his supervisor, and not paid for by the customers of his organization, internal or external. At all times you should force yourself to assess performance, not potential. A manager generally has two ways to raise the level of individual performance of his subordinates: by increasing motivation, the desire of each person to do his job well, and by increasing individual capability, which is where training comes in. \ud83d\udcd6 Patrick Lencioni, The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A Leadership Fable . \ud83d\udcd6 Work Rules!: Insights from Inside Google That Will Transform How You Live and Lead, Laszlo Bock.

A solution-oriented book. Train your interview team to apply a limited-consensus approach to hiring. When groups use limited consensus, not everyone may agree with the decision, but each person should be satisfied enough with a particular candidate\u2019s suitability not to block the decision to hire him or her. What if the vetoer is someone I don\u2019t want to keep in the organization?\u201d The answer to this is simple: In the interview process, only involve employees whose work you respect and value. If an employee isn\u2019t successful in his or her technical position, don\u2019t make that employee part of the interview team. Make sure members of your team interview an internal candidate the same way they would interview an external candidate. Know why you\u2019re hiring more people. Define your problems to define your hiring strategy. Sometimes, the main reason a hiring manager doesn\u2019t hire a candidate is that he or she has a gut feeling that the person just won\u2019t fit well with the culture. But a \u201cgut feeling\u201d is not a good reason not to hire someone, so train yourself to articulate culture-fit differences. I personally do not consider certification to mean anything much when I am hiring someone for a technical position. Because the knowledge tested is functional-skills book knowledge, make sure you understand what the person must do to maintain his or her certification and the value of that certification to your environment. Too often, internal recruiters look for tool and technology expertise or for advanced academic degrees, rather than for functional skill or for product-domain experience. If you feel the need to take notes, take them on paper, never on a computer. My reason for this is that when you use a computer, you have to sit behind a screen, which creates a barrier between you and the candidate. Promising an unconditional promotion is not just risky; it is stupid. Circumstances within the company can change; the employee may not perform up to expectations; the economy may tank.

Good managers don\u2019t have just one go-to management style nor do they have a notion of \u201cTHE ideal employee\u201d. Good managers can discern good intent from bad.
