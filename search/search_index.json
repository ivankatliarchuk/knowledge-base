Absence of a signal is itself a signal. The severity of an incident is measured by the number of rules broken in resolving it. The mobile hotspot you're paying for so you can leave your house while you're oncall only works at home and in the office. The only other person who knows how this works is also on vacation. If a post-mortem follow-up task is not picked up within a week, it's unlikely to be completed at all. That janky script you put together during the outage -- the one that uses expect(1) and ssh -t -t -- now is the foundation of the entire team's toolchest. NTP being off may not be a root cause, but it sure didn't help. UTC or GTFO . Your infrastructure uses a lot more self-signed certificates than you think. A lot more. In places that make you weep. Self-signed certificates beget long lived certs, which beget lack of certificate validity monitoring, which begets curl -k, which begets a lack of certificate deployment automation, which begets self-signed certificates. For any N applications, at most N/2+1 use the same certificate bundle. The system you're troubleshooting doesn't use the one the tool you're troubleshooting it with does. An API without a reference implementation and command-line client is called a gray box. Restricted shells are not as restricted as you think. Very few operations are truly idempotent. \"Asserting state\" beats \"monitoring for compliance\" any day. One in a Million is next Tuesday. People give talks at conferences not to convince others that their work is awesome and totally worth the time and effort they put in, but themselves. It's ok to use shell for complex stuff; it often times is easier, faster, and still less of a mess than juggling libraries and dependencies. There's nothing wrong with Perl. Ok, we all at times keep adding $, {, }, and @ in random places trying to make things work, but still. Serverless isn't. Y38K is already here , it's just not evenly distributed. If you determine \" human error \" as the root cause, then you're doing it wrong. Your network team has a way into the network that your security team doesn't know about. And don't even as much as mention the serial console and IPMI networks, but boy are you glad you have 'em. Blocking TCP port 53 traffic leads to very strange failures. Don't. Somewhere in your infrastructure a service you didn't know uses DNS for endpoint discovery in a very surprising way. Do. Not. Monkey. Around. With. /etc/hosts . If you break it, you own it - for now; if you fix it, you own it - forever. Turning it off and on again is actually quite a reasonable way to fix many things. A README.md in git is no substitute for a manual page that's shipped with your tool. A search for a document you know exists will only turn up links to documents referencing but not actually linking to the one you're looking for. The document you're looking for was marked as obsolete and not migrated to the new content management solution. Sure, your current content management system sucks, but it's still better than the one you're moving to. Nobody knows how git works; everybody simply rm -fr && git checkout's periodically. There are very few network restrictions creative and determined use of ssh(1) port forwarding can't overcome. This is both incredibly useful and concerning. It is tempting to jump right into implementing a solution when the right thing may well be to not do the thing that requires the solution in the first place. Turning things off permanently is surprisingly difficult . \" Ancient \" is a very relative term when it comes to software and protocols. \" Obsolete \" doesn't mean it's not in use and relied on. The sets of systems online before and after a data center power outage only intersect. Some of the old systems coming online will immediately cause a different outage. Some of your most critical services are kept alive by a handful of people whose job description does not mention those services at all. After the initial \"down for everybody or just me ermahgehrd Slack is down\" drop, productivity increases linearly throughout the duration of the outage. You're bound by the CAP theorem much more often than you may think. Halting Problem 's a bitch, too. Eventual consistency doesn't help when the system you're debugging hasn't converged yet. The source you're looking at is not the code running in production. strace(1)/ktrace(1) doesn't lie. Unless somebody's been playing LD_PRELOAD games. Schr\u00f6dinger's Backup -- \"The condition of any backup is unknown until a restore is attempted.\" -- is overly optimistic. There's an xkcd for the precise situation you find yourself in. (There's also one for at least half of these.) At some point in your career you will implement half of kerberos . Poorly. Any sufficiently successful product launch is indistinguishable from a DDoS; any sufficiently advanced user indistinguishable from an attacker. Debugging any sufficiently complex open source product is indistinguishable from reverse engineering a black box. \"We've always done it this way.\" is not a good reason by itself, but there's bound to be one for why. That reason may or may not be valid any longer, however. A junior engineer asking \"why\" and pointing out the docs don't reflect reality is at least as valuable as the senior engineer working blindly off tribal knowledge. Your herculean efforts to upgrade the OS across your entire fleet completed just in time for the EOL announcement of the version you upgraded to. This phenomenon was first described in Dante's Inferno as the Ninth Circle of Hell, Ring Four, aka RedHat Canto XXXIV. Containers create at least as many problems as they solve. The most ninja move the expert you hired for that third party black box product you rely on is to say \"Let me ping the support team\". Somewhere, somebody ran into this exact problem, but they never bothered to post a solution. That completely automated solution you set up requires at least three manual steps you didn't document. CAPEX budget always increases, OPEX budget always decreases. CAPEX costs can be reasonably estimated, OPEX costs can only be ballparked. Doubling your time estimate in the hopes of beating expectations won't work because your manager takes your estimate, has a hardy laugh, and then resets it back to what they already promised upchain. Your quarterly planning means bubkes when the next re-org rolls around. Most of your actual work is not covered by your OKRs . Recursively applying the Pareto Principle is a surprisingly accurate way to gauge your low hanging fruit, determine your high impact objectives, and ballpark your required effort. Although, to be honest, it only works in about 80% of cases . Management will always happily spend $$$ on outside consultants to tell them what you've been saying for years. Management will much rather invest in inventing a new, square wheel than fixing an old round one. In any organization practicing continuous integration , half of all commits are to fake out CI tests. Good software development practices do not always translate well to ops and friends. Mandatory code reviews do not automatically improve code quality nor reduce the frequency of incidents. Every new paradigm tends to mostly add layers of abstractions; cutting through them and identifying what basic principles continue to apply is half the battle. Real change can only be implemented above layer 7 . Prod is just another name for staging . Your source of truth lies. Also: it's incomplete. pcap or it didn't happen. grep(1) > Splunk (there, I said it) Multithreading is rarely worth the added complexity. Parallelism is not Concurrency. Simplicity is King . Nobody knows what exactly it is you do.","title":"operation lessons"},{"location":"devops/os/","tags":["os","devops","operation system","system"],"text":"Operation systems with different level of Isolations General user with Security and Privacy # Debian Arch Linux Monjaro Arch Fork Anonymity Focused # QubeOS Whonix Tails Security Focused # QubeOS SELinux Pure OS Pentetsing Focused # Kali Linux Parrot Black Arch BackBox Pentoo Browsers # Authentic TurboNet","title":"os"},{"location":"devops/os/#general-user-with-security-and-privacy","text":"Debian Arch Linux Monjaro Arch Fork","title":"General user with Security and Privacy"},{"location":"devops/os/#anonymity-focused","text":"QubeOS Whonix Tails","title":"Anonymity Focused"},{"location":"devops/os/#security-focused","text":"QubeOS SELinux Pure OS","title":"Security Focused"},{"location":"devops/os/#pentetsing-focused","text":"Kali Linux Parrot Black Arch BackBox Pentoo","title":"Pentetsing Focused"},{"location":"devops/os/#browsers","text":"Authentic TurboNet","title":"Browsers"},{"location":"devops/architecture-notes/audits/","tags":["architecture","audit","system","cis","soc","aws","cloud","platform","security","cyber-sec"],"text":"Cloud and Platform Audit # Audit compliances # SOC2: compliance SOC2: staring OWASP: security verification standard CIS: compliance benchmarks CIS: cisesecryity tooling CIS: aws compliance Audit Certifications # CCAK: Certificate of Cloud Auditing Knowledge CCSK: Certificate of Cloud Security Knowledge Audit Tooling # Current Tooling Audit Vendors #","title":"audits documentation"},{"location":"devops/architecture-notes/audits/#cloud-and-platform-audit","text":"","title":"Cloud and Platform Audit"},{"location":"devops/architecture-notes/audits/#audit-compliances","text":"SOC2: compliance SOC2: staring OWASP: security verification standard CIS: compliance benchmarks CIS: cisesecryity tooling CIS: aws compliance","title":"Audit compliances"},{"location":"devops/architecture-notes/audits/#audit-certifications","text":"CCAK: Certificate of Cloud Auditing Knowledge CCSK: Certificate of Cloud Security Knowledge","title":"Audit Certifications"},{"location":"devops/architecture-notes/audits/#audit-tooling","text":"Current Tooling","title":"Audit Tooling"},{"location":"devops/architecture-notes/audits/#audit-vendors","text":"","title":"Audit Vendors"},{"location":"devops/architecture-notes/design-data/","tags":["architecture","design","system","data"],"text":"data design The document contains information related to data design.

Checklist # Understand the Developer Program Policies . The Developer Program Policies are designed to ensure that the Play store remains a trusted resource for Android users. Review the policies thoroughly as there are consequences for violations. Prepare your developer account . Sign up for a developer account and check your developer account details are accurate. If you're going to sell products, set up your merchant account . Plan for localization . If you plan on including localized copies of your app at launch, start planning early and follow the Localization checklist . Plan for simultaneous releases . Releasing your app on multiple platforms and devices maximizes your promotion activities and the number of installs, so include it in your development plans upfront. If you can't launch your app on all platforms at once, ask for users' contact details and let them know when your app is ready. Test against the quality guidelines . Quality guidelines for all apps plus specific criteria for tablet, TV, and Auto apps provide testing templates. You use these to confirm that your apps offer the basic UI design, features, and functions expected by Android users. Target a recent API level . Google Play requires that new apps target at least Android 9.0 (API level 28), and that app updates target at least Android 9.0 starting on November 1, 2019. Build your Android App Bundle . When you're ready to make your app available to users, either for testing or as a final product, build your Android App Bundle in Android Studio. Google Play will use your app bundle to generate, sign and serve optimized APKs for each user's device, resulting in a smaller app to download and install. Run internal tests . Use the internal test track to push your app to up to 100 internal testers to get feedback before making your app available to external users in the closed, open, or production tracks. Use multiple closed test tracks for different versions of your app before pushing them to open test tracks or production. Plan your app's Play store listing . Prepare the descriptions, promotional graphics, screenshots, and videos you'll add to your app's Play store page. Make sure you include a link to your privacy policy if required. Localize your store listing in all the languages your app supports and for the countries you're targeting. Build interest in your app or game with pre-registration and set up a custom pre-registration listing page . Upload your Android App Bundle to the closed or an open test track . Closed and open testing tracks can help greatly in discovering issues with your app, giving you the opportunity to fix those issues and raise the quality of your initial release. Learn how to upload an Android App Bundle and learn about best practices for open tests. Define your app's device compatibility . Let the Play store know which Android versions and device screen sizes your app is designed to work on. Check the pre-launch reports . When you upload an Android App Bundle to the closed or open track, you'll receive a pre-launch report . With this report you can identify the issues found after your app is tested automatically on a wide-range of real devices running different versions of Android. Setup your app's price and countries of distribution . Once you've determined your monetization model , setup your app as free or paid and select the countries in which it will be distributed. Opt- in to the right distribution options . From the pricing & distribution page, opt-in to specific devices and programs, such as Wear OS by Google, Android TV, and Designed for families. Google Play can then review your app and, once approved, make it more discoverable for users. Set up your in-app products and subscriptions . Confirm the countries you can sell into and currency and tax issues to consider. Then set up your merchant account and add details and prices for your in-app products and subscriptions. Determine your app's content rating . Providing an appropriate rating for your app is a requirement of the Developer Program Policies but, it also ensures your app gets seen by the right age-based audiences. Final checks and publishing . First, go back and double check you've done everything on this list. Now you're ready to publish your app to the production channel. If you're releasing an app update, use staged rollouts to release your update to progressively more users. This allows you to halt the update if you find an issue, so you can limit the number of users it affects. Promote your app . Start promoting your app with the Google Play badge . Check out our other marketing tools and growth best practices to start growing your audience. Browse and reply to user reviews . Understand what users think of your app and reply to their reviews to address any issues you might not have spotted in testing. Check your vitals .

The Developer Program Policies are designed to ensure that the Play store remains a trusted resource for Android users. Review the policies thoroughly as there are consequences for violations. Prepare your developer account . Sign up for a developer account and check your developer account details are accurate. If you're going to sell products, set up your merchant account . Plan for localization . If you plan on including localized copies of your app at launch, start planning early and follow the Localization checklist . Plan for simultaneous releases . Releasing your app on multiple platforms and devices maximizes your promotion activities and the number of installs, so include it in your development plans upfront. If you can't launch your app on all platforms at once, ask for users' contact details and let them know when your app is ready. Test against the quality guidelines . Quality guidelines for all apps plus specific criteria for tablet, TV, and Auto apps provide testing templates. You use these to confirm that your apps offer the basic UI design, features, and functions expected by Android users. Target a recent API level . Google Play requires that new apps target at least Android 9.0 (API level 28), and that app updates target at least Android 9.0 starting on November 1, 2019. Build your Android App Bundle . When you're ready to make your app available to users, either for testing or as a final product, build your Android App Bundle in Android Studio. Google Play will use your app bundle to generate, sign and serve optimized APKs for each user's device, resulting in a smaller app to download and install. Run internal tests . Use the internal test track to push your app to up to 100 internal testers to get feedback before making your app available to external users in the closed, open, or production tracks. Use multiple closed test tracks for different versions of your app before pushing them to open test tracks or production. Plan your app's Play store listing . Prepare the descriptions, promotional graphics, screenshots, and videos you'll add to your app's Play store page. Make sure you include a link to your privacy policy if required. Localize your store listing in all the languages your app supports and for the countries you're targeting. Build interest in your app or game with pre-registration and set up a custom pre-registration listing page . Upload your Android App Bundle to the closed or an open test track . Closed and open testing tracks can help greatly in discovering issues with your app, giving you the opportunity to fix those issues and raise the quality of your initial release. Learn how to upload an Android App Bundle and learn about best practices for open tests. Define your app's device compatibility . Let the Play store know which Android versions and device screen sizes your app is designed to work on. Check the pre-launch reports . When you upload an Android App Bundle to the closed or open track, you'll receive a pre-launch report . With this report you can identify the issues found after your app is tested automatically on a wide-range of real devices running different versions of Android. Setup your app's price and countries of distribution . Once you've determined your monetization model , setup your app as free or paid and select the countries in which it will be distributed. Opt- in to the right distribution options . From the pricing & distribution page, opt-in to specific devices and programs, such as Wear OS by Google, Android TV, and Designed for families. Google Play can then review your app and, once approved, make it more discoverable for users. Set up your in-app products and subscriptions . Confirm the countries you can sell into and currency and tax issues to consider. Then set up your merchant account and add details and prices for your in-app products and subscriptions. Determine your app's content rating . Providing an appropriate rating for your app is a requirement of the Developer Program Policies but, it also ensures your app gets seen by the right age-based audiences. Final checks and publishing . First, go back and double check you've done everything on this list. Now you're ready to publish your app to the production channel. If you're releasing an app update, use staged rollouts to release your update to progressively more users. This allows you to halt the update if you find an issue, so you can limit the number of users it affects. Promote your app . Start promoting your app with the Google Play badge . Check out our other marketing tools and growth best practices to start growing your audience. Browse and reply to user reviews . Understand what users think of your app and reply to their reviews to address any issues you might not have spotted in testing. Check your vitals . Android vitals shows you important information based your app running on real devices to help you understand and fix stability and performance issues. Improving your vitals will result in a better user experience, more engaged users, and higher ratings. Woohoo, you've launched! What next? First, take a break.

Within each phase, there are specific areas of need that should be considered. What is an incident response plan for cyber security? Learn how to manage a data breach with the 6 phases in the incident response plan. # An incident response plan is a documented, written plan with 6 distinct phases that helps IT professionals and staff recognize and deal with a cybersecurity incident like a data breach or cyber attack. Properly creating and managing an incident response plan involves regular updates and training. Is an incident response plan a PCI DSS requirement? # Yes, Requirement 12 of the PCI DSS specifies the steps businesses must take relating to their incident response plan, including: 12.10.2\u2013Test incident response plan at least annually 12.10.3\u2013Assign certain employees to be available 24/7 to deal with incidences 12.10.4\u2013Properly and regularly train the staff with incident response responsibilities 12.10.5\u2013Set up alerts from intrusion-detection, intrusion-prevention, and file-integrity monitoring systems 12.10.6\u2013Implement a process to update and manage the incident response plan per industry and organizational changes How to create an incident response plan # An incident response plan should be set up to address a suspected data breach in a series of phases. Within each phase, there are specific areas of need that should be considered. The incident response phases are: Preparation Identification Containment Eradication Recovery Lessons Learned Let\u2019s look at each phase in more depth and point out the items that you need to address. 1. Preparation # This phase will be the work horse of your incident response planning, and in the end, the most crucial phase to protect your business. Part of this phase includes: Ensure your employees are properly trained regarding their incident response roles and responsibilities in the event of data breach Develop incident response drill scenarios and regularly conduct mock data breaches to evaluate your incident response plan. Ensure that all aspects of your incident response plan (training, execution, hardware and software resources, etc.) are approved and funded in advance Your response plan should be well documented, thoroughly explaining everyone\u2019s roles and responsibilities. Then the plan must be tested in order to assure that your employees will perform as they were trained. The more prepared your employees are, the less likely they\u2019ll make critical mistakes. Questions to address Has everyone been trained on security policies? Have your security policies and incident response plan been approved by appropriate management? Does the Incident Response Team know their roles and the required notifications to make? Have all Incident Response Team members participated in mock drills? SEE ALSO: 5 Things Your Incident Response Plan Needs 2. Identification # This is the process where you determine whether you\u2019ve been breached. A breach, or incident, could originate from many different areas. Questions to address When did the event happen? How was it discovered? Who discovered it? Have any other areas been impacted? What is the scope of the compromise? Does it affect operations? Has the source (point of entry) of the event been discovered? 3. Containment # When a breach is first discovered, your initial instinct may be to securely delete everything so you can just get rid of it. However, that will likely hurt you in the long run since you\u2019ll be destroying valuable evidence that you need to determine where the breach started and devise a plan to prevent it from happening again. Instead, contain the breach so it doesn\u2019t spread and cause further damage to your business. If you can, disconnect affected devices from the Internet. Have short-term and long-term containment strategies ready. It\u2019s also good to have a redundant system back-up to help restore business operations. That way, any compromised data isn\u2019t lost forever. This is also a good time to update and patch your systems, review your remote access protocols (requiring mandatory multi-factor authentication ), change all user and administrative access credentials and harden all passwords. WATCH: Forensics Lessons Learned Webinar Questions to address What\u2019s been done to contain the breach short term? What\u2019s been done to contain the breach long term? Has any discovered malware been quarantined from the rest of the environment? What sort of backups are in place? Does your remote access require true multi-factor authentication? Have all access credentials been reviewed for legitimacy, hardened and changed? Have you applied all recent security patches and updates? SEE ALSO: Forensic Research: Data Breach Trends 4. Eradication # Once you\u2019ve contained the issue, you need to find and eliminate the root cause of the breach. This means all malware should be securely removed, systems should again be hardened and patched, and updates should be applied. Whether you do this yourself, or hire a third party to do it, you need to be thorough. If any trace of malware or security issues remain in your systems, you may still be losing valuable data, and your liability could increase. Questions to address Have artifacts/malware from the attacker been securely removed? Has the system be hardened, patched, and updates applied? Can the system be re-imaged? 5. Recovery # This is the process of restoring and returning affected systems and devices back into your business environment. During this time, it\u2019s important to get your systems and business operations up and running again without the fear of another breach. Questions to address When can systems be returned to production? Have systems been patched, hardened and tested? Can the system be restored from a trusted back-up? How long will the affected systems be monitored and what will you look for when monitoring? What tools will ensure similar attacks will not reoccur? (File integrity monitoring, intrusion detection/protection, etc) 6. Lessons Learned # Once the investigation is complete, hold an after-action meeting with all Incident Response Team members and discuss what you\u2019ve learned from the data breach. This is where you will analyze and document everything about the breach. Determine what worked well in your response plan, and where there were some holes. Lessons learned from both mock and real events will help strengthen your systems against the future attacks. Questions to address What changes need to be made to the security? How should employee be trained differently? What weakness did the breach exploit? How will you ensure a similar breach doesn\u2019t happen again? No one wants to go through a data breach, but it\u2019s essential to plan for one. Prepare for it, know what to do when it happens, and learn all that you can afterwards.","title":"incident readiness phases"},{"location":"devops/check-lists/incident-response-phases/#what-is-an-incident-response-plan-for-cyber-security-learn-how-to-manage-a-data-breach-with-the-6-phases-in-the-incident-response-plan","text":"An incident response plan is a documented, written plan with 6 distinct phases that helps IT professionals and staff recognize and deal with a cybersecurity incident like a data breach or cyber attack.

Find out some of the essentials to include in your incident response plan Find out some of the essentials to include in your incident response plan. # Identify and prioritize your assets Identify your potential risks Establish procedures Assemble a response team Sell your plan to the company decision-makers When it comes to creating an incident response plan, it can seem a little overwhelming. Breaking it down into smaller components can help relieve some of your stress by making the project more manageable. Every business is different and will require different types of training, documents, policies, etc. that are tailored to your company\u2019s specific needs. But there are a few things most businesses should include in their incident response plans. A helpful way to organize your incident response plan is to have a series of itemized response lists. These are basically a series of \u201cto-do\u201d lists that provide needed information and tasks to perform during a data breach. SEE ALSO: How to Manage a Data Breach: 5 Steps to Keep Your Business Safe 1. Emergency contact/communications list # This list includes those that should be contacted in the event of a data breach. Those notifications could include: Response team Executive team Legal team Forensics company Public Relations Affected individuals The list should contain information on how to reach these contacts, and what you need to say. Pre-prepared emails and talking points can help communicate the issues more clearly and concisely, and could help you to stave off potentially bad press or other negative repercussions early in the event. 2. System backup and recovery processes list # This list will help you deal with the technical side of a data breach. Here are some things that should be included: Process for disconnecting from the Internet (Your processes need to state who is responsible to decide whether you disconnect or wait and see) System configuration diagrams that include device descriptions, IP addresses, OS, etc. Process for switching to redundant systems and preserving evidence Steps to test the system backup and verify it hasn\u2019t been compromised, and that it will not be affected by the suspected compromised systems This list gives you quick steps to preserve any compromised data and to quickly handle the breach as well as preserving your systems through backups. This list is crucial to help your business from losing too much data in a breach and to return to business as quickly as possible. SEE ALSO: 6 Phases in the Incident Response Plan 3. Forensics analysis list # This list is for businesses that have in-house forensic investigations resources. Your team will need to know the areas where to look for strange behavior and have access to system security and event logs. Some of the tools your team will need may include: Data acquisition tools Write-blockers Clean/wiped USB hard drives Cabling for all connections they could experience in your environment Forensic analysis tools such as, EnCase, FTK, X-Ways, etc If your business doesn\u2019t have access to an experienced computer forensic examiner in-house, you will want to consider vetting a forensics firm in advance with pre-completed agreements. This helps ensure you get an experienced investigator when you need it. SEE ALSO: What Does a Cyber Forensic Investigation Do and How Much Does It Cost? 4. Jumpbag list # This is a list for grab-and-go responses. When responding to a breach quickly, have a list of overall actions your employees need to take right away. It keeps the plan organized and prevents mistakes caused by panic. Some things to include in this list are: Incident handler\u2019s journal to document the incident Incident response team contact list USB hard drives and write-blockers USB multi-hub Flashlight, pens, notebooks All of the lists mentioned in this article USB and/or DVD-ROM containing bootable versions of your OS Computer tool kit Forensic tools and software (if your company has the expertise to perform its own forensic investigations\u2014if not, this is best left to professionals) 5. Security policy review list # This list deals with the aftermath of the breach and the response to it. It essentially helps your organization analyze the breach and what you can learn from it. This list should include documentation of the following things: When the breach was detected, by whom and what method Scope of the incident/affected systems Data that was put at-risk How the breach was contained and eradicated Work performed or changes made to systems during recovery Areas where the response plan was effective Areas that need improvement You should look at where your security controls failed, and how to improve them. The purpose of this list is to document the entire incident, what was done, what worked, what didn\u2019t, and what was learned.

By Neha Thethi, Information Security Analyst, BH Consulting Part 1 \u2013 Identity and Access Management in AWS This is the first in a five-part blog series that provides a checklist for proactive security and forensic readiness in the AWS cloud environment. This post relates to identity and access management in AWS. In a recent study by Dashlane regarding password strength, AWS was listed as an organization that supports weak password rules. However, AWS has numerous features that enable granular control for access to an account\u2019s resources by means of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) service. IAM provides control over who can use AWS resources (authentication) and how they can use those resources (authorization). The following list focuses on limiting access to, and use of, root account and user credentials; defining roles and responsibilities of system users; limiting automated access to AWS resources; and protecting access to data stored in storage buckets \u2013 including important data stored by services such as CloudTrail. The checklist provides best practice for the following: How are you protecting the access to and the use of AWS root account credentials ? How are you defining roles and responsibilities of system users to control human access to the AWS Management Console and API? How are you protecting the access to and the use of user account credentials ? How are you limiting automated access to AWS resources? How are you protecting your CloudTrail logs stored in S3 and your Billing S3 bucket ? Best-practice checklist # 1) How are you protecting the access to and the use of AWS root account credentials? Lock away your AWS account (root) login credentials Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) on root account Make minimal use of root account (or no use of root account at all if possible). Use IAM user instead to manage the account Do not use AWS root account to create API keys. 2) How are you defining roles and responsibilities of system users to control human access to the AWS Management Console and API? Create individual IAM users Configure a strong password policy for your users Enable MFA for privileged users Segregate defined roles and responsibilities of system users by creating user groups. Use groups to assign permissions to IAM users Clearly define and grant only the minimum privileges to users, groups, and roles that are needed to accomplish business requirements. Use AWS defined policies to assign permissions whenever possible Define and enforce user life-cycle policies Use roles to delegate access to users, applications, or services that don\u2019t normally have access to your AWS resources Use roles for applications that run on Amazon EC2 instances Use access levels (list, read, write and permissions management) to review IAM permissions Use policy conditions for extra security Regularly monitor user activity in your AWS account(s). 3) How are you protecting the access to and the use of user account credentials? Rotate credentials regularly Remove/deactivate unnecessary credentials Protect EC2 key pairs. Password protect the .pem and .ppk file on user machines Delete keys on your instances when someone leaves your organization or no longer requires access Regularly run least privilege checks using IAM user Access Advisor and IAM user Last Used Access Keys Delegate access by using roles instead of by sharing credentials Use IAM roles for cross-account access and identity federation Use temporary security instead of long-term access keys. 4) How are you limiting automated access to AWS resources ? Use IAM roles for EC2 and an AWS SDK or CLI Store static credentials securely that are used for automated access Use instance profiles or Amazon STS for dynamic authentication For increased security, implement alternative authentication mechanisms (e.g. LDAP or Active Directory) Protect API access using Multi-factor authentication (MFA). 5) How are you protecting your CloudTrail logs stored in S3 and your Billing S3 bucket? Limit access to users and roles on a \u201cneed-to-know\u201d basis for data stored in S3 Use bucket access permissions and object access permissions for fine-grained control over S3 resources Use bucket policies to grant other AWS accounts or IAM Part 2 # Excerpt # Protecting any computing infrastructure requires a layered approach. The layers are typically divided into physical, network, system, application, and data. By Neha Thethi, Information Security Analyst, BH Consulting Part 2: Infrastructure-level protection in AWS # This is the second in a five-part blog series that provides a checklist for proactive security and forensic readiness in the AWS cloud environment. This post relates to protecting your virtual infrastructure within AWS. Protecting any computing infrastructure requires a layered or defense-in-depth approach. The layers are typically divided into physical, network (perimeter and internal), system (or host), application, and data. In an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) environment, AWS is responsible for security \u2018of\u2019 the cloud including the physical perimeter, hardware, compute, storage and networking, while customers are responsible for security \u2018in\u2019 the cloud, or on layers above the hypervisor. This includes the operating system, perimeter and internal network, application and data. Infrastructure protection requires defining trust boundaries (e.g., network boundaries and packet filtering), system security configuration and maintenance (e.g., hardening and patching), operating system authentication and authorizations (e.g., users, keys, and access levels), and other appropriate policy enforcement points (e.g., web application firewalls and/or API gateways). The key AWS service that supports service-level protection is AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) while Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is the fundamental service that contributes to securing infrastructure hosted on AWS. VPC is the virtual equivalent of a traditional network operating in a data center, albeit with the scalability benefits of the AWS infrastructure. In addition, there are several other services or features provided by AWS that can be leveraged for infrastructure protection. The following list mainly focuses on network and host-level boundary protection, protecting integrity of the operating system on EC2 instances and Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) and security of containers on AWS. The checklist provides best practice for the following: How are you enforcing network and host-level boundary protection ? How are you protecting against distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks at network and application level? How are you managing the threat of malware ? How are you identifying vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the operating system of your Amazon EC2 instances ? How are you protecting the integrity of the operating system on your Amazon EC2 instances ? How are you ensuring security of containers on AWS? How are you ensuring only trusted Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) are launched? How are you creating secure custom (private or public) AMIs ? IMPORTANT NOTE: Identity and access management is an integral part of securing an infrastructure, however, you\u2019ll notice that the following checklist does not focus on the AWS IAM service. I have covered this in a separate checklist on IAM best practices here . Best-practice checklist # 1. How are you enforcing network and host-level boundary protection? Establish appropriate network design for your workload to ensure only desired network paths and routing are allowed For large-scale deployments, design network security in layers \u2013 external, DMZ, and internal When designing NACL rules, consider that it\u2019s a stateless firewall, so ensure to define both outbound and inbound rules Create secure VPCs using network segmentation and security zoning Carefully plan routing and server placement in public and private subnets. Place instances (EC2 and RDS) within VPC subnets and restrict access using security groups and NACLs Use non-overlapping IP addresses with other VPCs or data centre in use Control network traffic by using security groups (stateful firewall, outside OS layer), NACLs (stateless firewall, at subnet level), bastion host, host based firewalls, etc. Use Virtual Gateway (VGW) where Amazon VPC-based resources require remote network connectivity Use IPSec or AWS Direct Connect for trusted connections to other sites Use VPC Flow Logs for information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC Protect data in transit to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data, as well as the identities of the communicating parties. 2. How are you protecting against distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks at network and application level? Use firewalls including Security groups, network access control lists, and host based firewalls Use rate limiting to protect scarce resources from overconsumption Use Elastic Load Balancing and Auto Scaling to configure web servers to scale out when under attack (based on load), and shrink back when the attack stops Use AWS Shield, a managed Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection service, that safeguards web applications running on AWS Use Amazon CloudFront to absorb DoS/DDoS flooding attacks Use AWS WAF with AWS CloudFront to help protect your web applications from common web exploits that could affect application availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources Use Amazon CloudWatch to detect DDoS attacks against your application Use VPC Flow Logs to gain visibility into traffic targeting your application. 3. How are you managing the threat of malware? Give users the minimum privileges they need to carry out their tasks Patch external-facing and internal systems to the latest security level. Use a reputable and up-to-date antivirus and antispam solution on your system. Install host based IDS with file integrity checking and rootkit detection Use IDS/IPS systems for statistical/behavioural or signature-based algorithms to detect and contain network attacks and Trojans. Launch instances from trusted AMIs only Only install and run trusted software from a trusted software provider (note: MD5 or SHA-1 should not be trusted if software is downloaded from random source on the internet) Avoid SMTP open relay, which can be used to spread spam, and which might also represent a breach of the AWS Acceptable Use Policy. 4. How are you identifying vulnerabilities or misconfigurationsin the operating system of your Amazon EC2 instances? Define approach for securing your system, consider the level of access needed and take a least-privilege approach Open only the ports needed for communication, harden OS and disable permissive configurations Remove or disable unnecessary user accounts. Remove or disable all unnecessary functionality. Change vendor-supplied defaults prior to deploying new applications. Automate deployments and remove operator access to reduce attack surface area using tools such as EC2 Systems Manager Run Command Ensure operating system and application configurations, such as firewall settings and anti-malware definitions, are correct and up-to-date; Use EC2 Systems Manager State Manager to define and maintain consistent operating system configurations Ensure an inventory of instances and installed software is maintained; Use EC2 Systems Manager Inventory to collect and query configuration about your instances and installed software Perform routine vulnerability assessments when updates or deployments are pushed; Use Amazon Inspector to identify vulnerabilities or deviations from best practices in your guest operating systems and applications Leverage automated patching tools such as EC2 Systems Manager Patch Manager to help you deploy operating system and software patches automatically across large groups of instances Use AWS CloudTrail, AWS Config, and AWS Config Rules as they provide audit and change tracking features for auditing AWS resource changes. Use template definition and management tools, including AWS CloudFormation to create standard, preconfigured environments. 5. How are you protecting the integrity of the operating system on your Amazon EC2 instances? Use file integrity controls for Amazon EC2 instances Use host-based intrusion detection controls for Amazon EC2 instances Use a custom Amazon Machine Image (AMI) or configuration management tools (such as Puppet or Chef) that provide secure settings by default. 6. How are you ensuring security of containers on AWS? Run containers on top of virtual machines Run small images, remove unnecessary binaries Use many small instances to reduce attack surface Segregate containers based on criteria such as role or customer and risk Set containers to run as non-root user Set filesystems to be read-only Limit container networking; Use AWS ECS to manage containers and define communication between containers Leverage Linux kernel security features using tools like SELinux, Seccomp, AppArmor Perform vulnerability scans of container images Allow only approved images during build Use tools such as Docker Bench to automate security checks Avoid embedding secrets into images or environment variables, Use S3-based secrets storage instead. 7. How are you ensuring only trusted Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) are launched? Treat shared AMIs as any foreign code that you might consider deploying in your own data centre and perform the appropriate due diligence Look for description of shared AMI, and the AMI ID, in the Amazon EC2 forum Check aliased owner in the account field to find public AMIs from Amazon. 8. How are you creating secure custom (private or public) AMIs? Disable root API access keys and secret key Configure Public Key authentication for remote login Restrict access to instances from limited IP ranges using Security Groups Use bastion hosts to enforce control and visibility Protect the .pem file on user machines Delete keys from the authorized_keys file on your instances when someone leaves your organization or no longer requires access Rotate credentials (DB, Access Keys) Regularly run least privilege checks using IAM user Access Advisor and IAM user Last Used Access Keys Ensure that software installed does not use default internal accounts and passwords. Change vendor-supplied defaults before creating new AMIs Disable services and protocols that authenticate users in clear text over the network, or otherwise insecurely. Disable non-essential network services on startup. Only administrative services (SSH/RDP) and the services required for essential applications should be started. Ensure all software is up to date with relevant security patches For in instantiated AMIs, update security controls by running custom bootstrapping Bash or Microsoft Windows PowerShell scripts; or use bootstrapping applications such as Puppet, Chef, Capistrano, Cloud-Init and Cfn-Init Follow a formalised patch management procedure for AMIs Ensure that the published AMI does not violate the Amazon Web Services Acceptable Use Policy. Examples of violations include open SMTP relays or proxy servers. For more information, see the Amazon Web Services Acceptable Use Policy http://aws.amazon.com/aup/ Security at the infrastructure level, or any level for that matter, certainly requires more than just a checklist.

I have covered this in a separate checklist on IAM best practices here .","title":"Part 2: Infrastructure-level protection in AWS"},{"location":"devops/check-lists/infrastructure-forensic-readiness/#best-practice-checklist_1","text":"1. How are you enforcing network and host-level boundary protection? Establish appropriate network design for your workload to ensure only desired network paths and routing are allowed For large-scale deployments, design network security in layers \u2013 external, DMZ, and internal When designing NACL rules, consider that it\u2019s a stateless firewall, so ensure to define both outbound and inbound rules Create secure VPCs using network segmentation and security zoning Carefully plan routing and server placement in public and private subnets. Place instances (EC2 and RDS) within VPC subnets and restrict access using security groups and NACLs Use non-overlapping IP addresses with other VPCs or data centre in use Control network traffic by using security groups (stateful firewall, outside OS layer), NACLs (stateless firewall, at subnet level), bastion host, host based firewalls, etc. Use Virtual Gateway (VGW) where Amazon VPC-based resources require remote network connectivity Use IPSec or AWS Direct Connect for trusted connections to other sites Use VPC Flow Logs for information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC Protect data in transit to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data, as well as the identities of the communicating parties. 2. How are you protecting against distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks at network and application level? Use firewalls including Security groups, network access control lists, and host based firewalls Use rate limiting to protect scarce resources from overconsumption Use Elastic Load Balancing and Auto Scaling to configure web servers to scale out when under attack (based on load), and shrink back when the attack stops Use AWS Shield, a managed Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection service, that safeguards web applications running on AWS Use Amazon CloudFront to absorb DoS/DDoS flooding attacks Use AWS WAF with AWS CloudFront to help protect your web applications from common web exploits that could affect application availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources Use Amazon CloudWatch to detect DDoS attacks against your application Use VPC Flow Logs to gain visibility into traffic targeting your application. 3. How are you managing the threat of malware? Give users the minimum privileges they need to carry out their tasks Patch external-facing and internal systems to the latest security level. Use a reputable and up-to-date antivirus and antispam solution on your system. Install host based IDS with file integrity checking and rootkit detection Use IDS/IPS systems for statistical/behavioural or signature-based algorithms to detect and contain network attacks and Trojans. Launch instances from trusted AMIs only Only install and run trusted software from a trusted software provider (note: MD5 or SHA-1 should not be trusted if software is downloaded from random source on the internet) Avoid SMTP open relay, which can be used to spread spam, and which might also represent a breach of the AWS Acceptable Use Policy. 4. How are you identifying vulnerabilities or misconfigurationsin the operating system of your Amazon EC2 instances? Define approach for securing your system, consider the level of access needed and take a least-privilege approach Open only the ports needed for communication, harden OS and disable permissive configurations Remove or disable unnecessary user accounts. Remove or disable all unnecessary functionality. Change vendor-supplied defaults prior to deploying new applications. Automate deployments and remove operator access to reduce attack surface area using tools such as EC2 Systems Manager Run Command Ensure operating system and application configurations, such as firewall settings and anti-malware definitions, are correct and up-to-date; Use EC2 Systems Manager State Manager to define and maintain consistent operating system configurations Ensure an inventory of instances and installed software is maintained; Use EC2 Systems Manager Inventory to collect and query configuration about your instances and installed software Perform routine vulnerability assessments when updates or deployments are pushed; Use Amazon Inspector to identify vulnerabilities or deviations from best practices in your guest operating systems and applications Leverage automated patching tools such as EC2 Systems Manager Patch Manager to help you deploy operating system and software patches automatically across large groups of instances Use AWS CloudTrail, AWS Config, and AWS Config Rules as they provide audit and change tracking features for auditing AWS resource changes. Use template definition and management tools, including AWS CloudFormation to create standard, preconfigured environments. 5. How are you protecting the integrity of the operating system on your Amazon EC2 instances? Use file integrity controls for Amazon EC2 instances Use host-based intrusion detection controls for Amazon EC2 instances Use a custom Amazon Machine Image (AMI) or configuration management tools (such as Puppet or Chef) that provide secure settings by default. 6. How are you ensuring security of containers on AWS? Run containers on top of virtual machines Run small images, remove unnecessary binaries Use many small instances to reduce attack surface Segregate containers based on criteria such as role or customer and risk Set containers to run as non-root user Set filesystems to be read-only Limit container networking; Use AWS ECS to manage containers and define communication between containers Leverage Linux kernel security features using tools like SELinux, Seccomp, AppArmor Perform vulnerability scans of container images Allow only approved images during build Use tools such as Docker Bench to automate security checks Avoid embedding secrets into images or environment variables, Use S3-based secrets storage instead. 7. How are you ensuring only trusted Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) are launched? Treat shared AMIs as any foreign code that you might consider deploying in your own data centre and perform the appropriate due diligence Look for description of shared AMI, and the AMI ID, in the Amazon EC2 forum Check aliased owner in the account field to find public AMIs from Amazon. 8. How are you creating secure custom (private or public) AMIs? Disable root API access keys and secret key Configure Public Key authentication for remote login Restrict access to instances from limited IP ranges using Security Groups Use bastion hosts to enforce control and visibility Protect the .pem file on user machines Delete keys from the authorized_keys file on your instances when someone leaves your organization or no longer requires access Rotate credentials (DB, Access Keys) Regularly run least privilege checks using IAM user Access Advisor and IAM user Last Used Access Keys Ensure that software installed does not use default internal accounts and passwords. Change vendor-supplied defaults before creating new AMIs Disable services and protocols that authenticate users in clear text over the network, or otherwise insecurely. Disable non-essential network services on startup. Only administrative services (SSH/RDP) and the services required for essential applications should be started. Ensure all software is up to date with relevant security patches For in instantiated AMIs, update security controls by running custom bootstrapping Bash or Microsoft Windows PowerShell scripts; or use bootstrapping applications such as Puppet, Chef, Capistrano, Cloud-Init and Cfn-Init Follow a formalised patch management procedure for AMIs Ensure that the published AMI does not violate the Amazon Web Services Acceptable Use Policy. Examples of violations include open SMTP relays or proxy servers. For more information, see the Amazon Web Services Acceptable Use Policy http://aws.amazon.com/aup/ Security at the infrastructure level, or any level for that matter, certainly requires more than just a checklist. For a comprehensive insight into infrastructure security within AWS, we suggest reading the following AWS whitepapers \u2013 AWS Security Pillar and AWS Security Best Practises .

Application development # The readiness probe determines when a container can receive traffic. The kubelet executes the checks and decides if the app can receive traffic or not. The liveness probe determines when a container should be restarted. The kubelet executes the check and decides if the container should be restarted. Resources: The official Kubernetes documentation offers some practical advice on how to configure Liveness, Readiness and Startup Probes . Liveness probes are dangerous has some information on how to set (or not) dependencies in your readiness probes. Containers have Readiness probes # Please note that there's no default value for readiness and liveness. If you don't set the readiness probe, the kubelet assumes that the app is ready to receive traffic as soon as the container starts. If the container takes 2 minutes to start, all the requests to it will fail for those 2 minutes. Containers crash when there's a fatal error # If the application reaches an unrecoverable error, you should let it crash . Examples of such unrecoverable errors are: an uncaught exception a typo in the code (for dynamic languages) unable to load a header or dependency Please note that you should not signal a failing Liveness probe. Instead, you should immediately exit the process and let the kubelet restart the container. Configure a passive Liveness probe # The Liveness probe is designed to restart your container when it's stuck. Consider the following scenario: if your application is processing an infinite loop, there's no way to exit or ask for help. When the process is consuming 100% CPU, it won't have time to reply to the (other) Readiness probe checks, and it will be eventually removed from the Service. However, the Pod is still registered as an active replica for the current Deployment. If you don't have a Liveness probe, it stays Running but detached from the Service. In other words, not only is the process not serving any requests, but it is also consuming resources. What should you do? Expose an endpoint from your app The endpoint always replies with a success response Consume the endpoint from the Liveness probe Please note that you should not use the Liveness probe to handle fatal errors in your app and request Kubernetes to restart the app. Instead, you should let the app crash. The Liveness probe should be used as a recovery mechanism only in case the process is not responsive. Liveness probes values aren't the same as the Readiness # When Liveness and Readiness probes are pointing to the same endpoint, the effects of the probes are combined. When the app signals that it's not ready or live, the kubelet detaches the container from the Service and delete it at the same time . You might notice dropping connections because the container does not have enough time to drain the current connections or process the incoming ones. You can dig deeper in the following article that discussed graceful shutdown . Apps Independent # If the app connects to a database, you might think that returning a failing readiness probe until the database is ready is a good idea \u2014 it is not. Consider the following scenario: you have one front-end app that depends on a backend API. If the API is flaky (e.g. it's unavailable from time to time due to a bug), the readiness probe fails, and the dependent readiness in the front-end app fail as well. And you have downtime. More in general, a failure in a dependency downstream could propagate to all apps upstream and eventually, bring down your front-end facing layer as well. The Readiness probes are independent # The readiness probe doesn't include dependencies to services such as: databases database migrations APIs third party services You can explore what happens when there're dependencies in the readiness probes in this essay . The app retries connecting to dependent services # When the app starts, it shouldn't crash because a dependency such as a database isn't ready. Instead, the app should keep retrying to connect to the database until it succeeds. Kubernetes expects that application components can be started in any order. When you make sure that your app can reconnect to a dependency such as a database you know you can deliver a more robust and resilient service. Graceful Shutdown # Instead, you should wait for the existing connection to drain and stop processing new ones. Please notice that, when a Pod is terminated, the endpoints for that Pod are removed from the Service. However, it might take some time before component such as kube-proxy or the Ingress controller is notified of the change. You can find a detail explanation on how graceful shutdown works in handling client requests correctly with Kubernetes . The correct graceful shutdown sequence is: upon receiving SIGTERM the server stops accepting new connections completes all active requests then immediately kills all keepalive connections and the process exits You can test that your app gracefully shuts down with this tool: kube-sigterm-test . The app doesn't shut down on SIGTERM, but it gracefully terminates connections # It might take some time before a component such as kube-proxy or the Ingress controller is notified of the endpoint changes. Hence, traffic might still flow to the Pod despite it being marked as terminated. The app should stop accepting new requests on all remaining connections, and close these once the outgoing queue is drained. If you need a refresher on how endpoints are propagated in your cluster, read this article on how to handle client requests properly . The app still processes incoming requests in the grace period # You might want to consider using the container lifecycle events such as the preStop handler to customize what happened before a Pod is deleted. The CMD in the Dockerfile forwards the SIGTERM to the process # You can be notified when the Pod is about to be terminated by capturing the SIGTERM signal in your app. You should also pay attention to forwarding the signal to the right process in your container . Close all idle keep-alive sockets # If the calling app is not closing the TCP connection (e.g. using TCP keep-alive or a connection pool) it will connect to one Pod and not use the other Pods in that Service. But what happens when a Pod is deleted? Ideally, the request should go to another Pod. However, the calling app has a long-lived connection open with the Pod that is about to be terminated, and it will keep using it. On the other hand, you shouldn't abruptly terminate long-lived connections. Instead, you should terminate them before shutting down the app. You can read about keep-alive connections on this article about gracefully shutting down a Nodejs HTTP server . a hardware failure of the physical machine cloud provider or hypervisor failure a kernel panic Pods deployed in those nodes are lost too. Also, there are other scenarios where Pods could be deleted: directly deleting a pod (accident) draining a node removing a pod from a node to permit another Pod to fit on that node Any of the above scenarios could affect the availability of your app and potentially cause downtime. You should protect from a scenario where all of your Pods are made unavailable, and you aren't able to serve live traffic. Run more than one replica for your Deployment # Never run a single Pod individually. Instead consider deploying your Pod as part of a Deployment, DaemonSet, ReplicaSet or StatefulSet. Running more than one instance of your Pods guarantees that deleting a single Pod won't cause downtime . Avoid Pods being placed into a single node # Even if you run several copies of your Pods, there are no guarantees that losing a node won't take down your service. Consider the following scenario: you have 11 replicas on a single cluster node. If the node is made unavailable, the 11 replicas are lost, and you have downtime. You should apply anti-affinity rules to your Deployments so that Pods are spread in all the nodes of your cluster . The inter-pod affinity and anti-affinity documentation describe how you can you could change your Pod to be located (or not) in the same node. Set Pod disruption budgets # When a node is drained, all the Pods on that node are deleted and rescheduled. But what if you are under heavy load and you can't lose more than 50% of your Pods? The drain event could affect your availability. To protect the Deployments from unexpected events that could take down several Pods at the same time, you can define Pod Disruption Budget. Imagine saying: \"Kubernetes, please make sure that there are always at least 5 Pods running for my app\". Kubernetes will prevent the drain event if the final state results in less than 5 Pods for that Deployment. The official documentation is an excellent place to start to understand Pod Disruption Budgets . Resource Utilization # Docker containers are the blocks; servers are the boards, and the scheduler is the player. To maximise the efficiency of the scheduler, you should share with Kubernetes details such as resource utilisation, workload priorities and overheads. Set memory limits and requests for all containers # Resource limits are used to constrain how much CPU and memory your containers can utilise and are set using the resources property of a containerSpec . The scheduler uses those as one of metrics to decide which node is best suited for the current Pod. A container without a memory limit has memory utilisation of zero \u2014 according to the scheduler. An unlimited number of Pods if schedulable on any nodes leading to resource overcommitment and potential node (and kubelet) crashes. The same applies to CPU limits. But should you always set limits and requests for memory and CPU? Yes and no. If your process goes over the memory limit, the process is terminated. Since CPU is a compressible resource, if your container goes over the limit, the process is throttled. Even if it could have used some of the CPU that was available at that moment. ** CPU limits are hard. **s If you wish to dig deeper into CPU and memory limits you should check out the following articles: Understanding resource limits in kubernetes: memory Understanding resource limits in kubernetes: cpu time Please note that if you are not sure what should be the right CPU or memory limit, you can use the Vertical Pod Autoscaler in Kubernetes with the recommendation mode turned on. The autoscaler profiles your app and recommends limits for it. Set CPU request to 1 CPU or below # Unless you have computational intensive jobs, it is recommended to set the request to 1 CPU or below . Disable CPU limits \u2014 unless you have a good use case # CPU is measured as CPU timeunits per timeunit. cpu: 1 means 1 CPU second per second. If you have 1 thread, you can't consume more than 1 CPU second per second. If you have 2 threads, you can consume 1 CPU second in 0.5 seconds. 8 threads can consume 1 CPU second in 0.125 seconds. After that, your process is throttled. If you're not sure about what's the best settings for your app, it's better not to set the CPU limits. If you wish to learn more, this article digs deeper in CPU requests and limits . The namespace has a LimitRange # If you think you might forget to set memory and CPU limits, you should consider using a LimitRange object to define the standard size for a container deployed in the current namespace. The official documentation about LimitRange is an excellent place to start. Set an appropriate Quality of Service (QoS) for Pods # When a node goes into an overcommitted state (i.e. using too many resources) Kubernetes tries to evict some of the Pod in that Node. Kubernetes ranks and evicts the Pods according to a well-defined logic. You can find more about configuring the quality of service for your Pods on the official documentation. Tagging Resources # A label is a key-value pair without any pre-defined meaning. They can be applied to all resources in your cluster from Pods to Service, Ingress manifests, Endpoints, etc. You can use labels to categorize resources by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria. So you could choose a label to tag a Pod in an environment such as \"this pod is running in production\" or \"the payment team owns that Deployment\". You can also omit labels altogether. However, you might want to consider using labels to cover the following categories: technical labels such as the environment labels for automation label related to your business such as cost-centre allocation label related to security such as compliance requirements Resources have technical labels defined # You could tag your Pods with: name , the name of the application such \"User API\" instance , a unique name identifying the instance of an application (you could use the container image tag) version , the current version of the appl (an incremental counter) component , the component within the architecture such as \"API\" or \"database\" part-of , the name of a higher-level application this one is part of such as \"payment gateway\" managed-by , the tool being used to manage the operation of an application such as \"kubectl\" or \"Helm\" Here's an example on how you could use such labels in a Deployment: `deployment.yaml` ```yml apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: deployment labels: app.kubernetes.io/name: user-api app.kubernetes.io/instance: user-api-5fa65d2 app.kubernetes.io/version: \"42\" app.kubernetes.io/component: api app.kubernetes.io/part-of: payment-gateway app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: kubectl spec: replicas: 3 selector: matchLabels: application: my-app template: metadata: labels: app.kubernetes.io/name: user-api app.kubernetes.io/instance: user-api-5fa65d2 app.kubernetes.io/version: \"42\" app.kubernetes.io/component: api app.kubernetes.io/part-of: payment-gateway spec: containers: - name: app image: myapp ``` Those labels are [recommended by the official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/common-labels/). > Please not that you're recommended to tag **all resources**. Resources have business labels defined # You could tag your Pods with: owner , used to identify who is responsible for the resource project , used to determine the project that the resource belongs to business-unit , used to identify the cost centre or business unit associated with a resource; typically for cost allocation and tracking Here's an example on how you could use such labels in a Deployment: deployment.yaml apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: deployment labels: owner: payment-team project: fraud-detection business-unit: \"80432\" spec: replicas: 3 selector: matchLabels: application: my-app template: metadata: labels: owner: payment-team project: fraud-detection business-unit: \"80432\" spec: containers: - name: app image: myapp You can explore labels and tagging for resources on the AWS tagging strategy page . The article isn't specific to Kubernetes but explores some of the most common strategies for tagging resources. Please not that you're recommended to tag all resources . Resources have security labels defined # You could tag your Pods with: confidentiality , an identifier for the specific data-confidentiality level a resource supports compliance , an identifier for workloads designed to adhere to specific compliance requirements Here's an example on how you could use such labels in a Deployment: deployment.yaml apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: deployment labels: confidentiality: official compliance: pci spec: replicas: 3 selector: matchLabels: application: my-app template: metadata: labels: confidentiality: official compliance: pci spec: containers: - name: app image: myapp You can explore label and tagging for resources on the AWS tagging strategy page .

The logs are particularly useful for debugging problems and monitoring app activity. The application logs to stdout and stderr # There are two logging strategies: passive and active . Apps that use passive logging are unaware of the logging infrastructure and log messages to standard outputs. This best practice is part of the twelve-factor app . In active logging, the app makes network connections to intermediate aggregators, sends data to third-party logging services, or writes directly to a database or index. Active logging is considered an antipattern, and it should be avoided. Avoid sidecars for logging (if you can) # If you wish to apply log transformations to an application with a non-standard log event model , you may want to use a sidecar container. With a sidecar container, you can normalise the log entries before they are shipped elsewhere. For example, you may want to transform Apache logs into Logstash JSON format before shipping it to the logging infrastructure. However, if you have control over the application, you could output the right format, to begin with. You could save on running an extra container for each Pod in your cluster. Scaling # Containers have a local filesystem and you might be tempted to use it for persisting data. However, storing persistent data in a container's local filesystem prevents the encompassing Pod from being scaled horizontally (that is, by adding or removing replicas of the Pod). This is because, by using the local filesystem, each container maintains its own \"state\", which means that the states of Pod replicas may diverge over time. This results in inconsistent behaviour from the user's point of view (for example, a specific piece of user information is available when the request hits one Pod, but not when the request hits another Pod). Instead, any persistent information should be saved at a central place outside the Pods. For example, in a PersistentVolume in the cluster, or even better in some storage service outside the cluster. Containers do not store any state in their local filesystem # Containers have a local filesystem and you might be tempted to use it for persisting data. However, storing persistent data in a container's local filesystem prevents the encompassing Pod from being scaled horizontally (that is, by adding or removing replicas of the Pod). This is because, by using the local filesystem, each container maintains its own \"state\", which means that the states of Pod replicas may diverge over time. This results in inconsistent behaviour from the user's point of view (for example, a specific piece of user information is available when the request hits one Pod, but not when the request hits another Pod). Instead, any persistent information should be saved at a central place outside the Pods. For example, in a PersistentVolume in the cluster, or even better in some storage service outside the cluster. Use the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for apps with variable usage patterns # The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) is a built-in Kubernetes feature that monitors your application and automatically adds or removes Pod replicas based on the current usage. Configuring the HPA allows your app to stay available and responsive under any traffic conditions, including unexpected spikes. To configure the HPA to autoscale your app, you have to create a HorizontalPodAutoscaler resource, which defines what metric to monitor for your app. The HPA can monitor either built-in resource metric (CPU and memory usage of your Pods) or custom metrics. In the case of custom metrics, you are also responsible for collecting and exposing these metrics, which you can do, for example, with Prometheus and the Prometheus Adapter . Don't use the Vertical Pod Autoscaler while it's still in beta # Analogous to the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) , there exists the Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) . The VPA can automatically adapt the resource requests and limits of your Pods so that when a Pod needs more resources, it can get them (increasing/decreasing the resources of a single Pod is called vertical scaling , as opposed to horizontal scaling , which means increasing/decreasing the number of replicas of a Pod). This can be useful for scaling applications that can't be scaled horizontally. However, the VPA is curently in beta and it has some known limitations (for example, scaling a Pod by changing its resource requirements, requires the Pod to be killed and restarted). Given these limitations, and the fact that most applications on Kubernetes can be scaled horizontally anyway, it is recommended to not use the VPA in production (at least until there is a stable version). Use the Cluster Autoscaler if you have highly varying workloads # The Cluster Autoscaler is another type of \"autoscaler\" (besides the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler and Vertical Pod Autoscaler ). The Cluster Autoscaler can automatically scale the size of your cluster by adding or removing worker nodes. A scale-up operation happens when a Pod fails to be scheduled because of insufficient resources on the existing worker nodes. In this case, the Cluster Autoscaler creates a new worker node, so that the Pod can be scheduled. Similarly, when the utilisation of the existing worker nodes is low, the Cluster Autoscaler can scale down by evicting all the workloads from one of the worker nodes and removing it. Using the Cluster Autoscaler makes sense for highly variable workloads, for example, when the number of Pods may multiply in a short time, and then go back to the previous value. In such scenarios, the Cluster Autoscaler allows you to meet the demand spikes without wasting resources by overprovisioning worker nodes. However, if your workloads do not vary so much, it may not be worth to set up the Cluster Autoscaler, as it may never be triggered. If your workloads grow slowly and monotonically, it may be enough to monitor the utilisations of your existing worker nodes and add an additional worker node manually when they reach a critical value. Configuration and secrets Configuration should be maintained outside the application code. This has several benefits. First, changing the configuration does not require recompiling the application. Second, the configuration can be updated when the application is running. Third, the same code can be used in different environments. In Kubernetes, the configuration can be saved in ConfigMaps, which can then be mounted into containers as volumes are passed in as environment variables. Save only non-sensitive configuration in ConfigMaps. For sensitive information (such as credentials), use the Secret resource. Externalise all configuration # Configuration should be maintained outside the application code. This has several benefits. First, changing the configuration does not require recompiling the application. Second, the configuration can be updated when the application is running. Third, the same code can be used in different environments. In Kubernetes, the configuration can be saved in ConfigMaps, which can then be mounted into containers as volumes are passed in as environment variables. Save only non-sensitive configuration in ConfigMaps. For sensitive information (such as credentials), use the Secret resource. Mount Secrets as volumes, not enviroment variables # The content of Secret resources should be mounted into containers as volumes rather than passed in as environment variables. This is to prevent that the secret values appear in the command that was used to start the container, which may be inspected by individuals that shouldn't have access to the secret values. 2. Governance # You shouldn't allow your user to use more resources than what you agreed in advance. Cluster administrators can set constraints to limit the number of objects or amount of computing resources that are used in your project with quotas and limit ranges. You should check out the official documentation if you need a refresher on limit ranges Namespaces have LimitRange # Containers without limits can lead to resource contention with other containers and unoptimized consumption of computing resources. Kubernetes has two features for constraining resource utilisation: ResourceQuota and LimitRange. With the LimitRange object, you can define default values for resource requests and limits for individual containers inside namespaces. Any container created inside that namespace, without request and limit values explicitly specified, is assigned the default values. You should check out the official documentation if you need a refresher on resource quotas . Namespaces have ResourceQuotas # With ResourceQuotas, you can limit the total resource consumption of all containers inside a Namespace. Defining a resource quota for a namespace limits the total amount of CPU, memory or storage resources that can be consumed by all containers belonging to that namespace. You can also set quotas for other Kubernetes objects such as the number of Pods in the current namespace. If you're thinking that someone could exploit your cluster and create 20000 ConfigMaps, using the LimitRange is how you can prevent that. the container being compromised the container using resources on the node that are not allowed such as process, network or file system More in general, you should restrict what the Pod can do to the bare minimum. Enable Pod Security Policies # For example, you can use Kubernetes Pod security policies for restricting: Access the host process or network namespace Running privileged containers The user that the container is running as Access the host filesystem Linux capabilities, Seccomp or SELinux profiles Choosing the right policy depends on the nature of your cluster. The following article explains some of the Kubernetes Pod Security Policy best practices Disable privileged containers # In a Pod, containers can run in \"privileged\" mode and have almost unrestricted access to resources on the host system. While there are specific use cases where this level of access is necessary, in general, it's a security risk to let your containers do this. Valid uses cases for privileged Pods include using hardware on the node such as GPUs. You can learn more about security contexts and privileges containers from this article . Use a read-only filesystem in containers # Running a read-only file system in your containers forces your containers to be immutable. Not only does this mitigate some old (and risky) practices such as hot patching, but also helps you prevent the risks of malicious processes storing or manipulating data inside a container. Running containers with a read-only file system might sound straightforward, but it might come with some complexity. What if you need to write logs or store files in a temporary folder? You can learn about the trade-offs in this article on running containers securely in production . Prevent containers from running as root # A process running in a container is no different from any other process on the host, except it has a small piece of metadata that declares that it's in a container. Hence, root in a container is the same root (uid 0) as on the host machine. If a user manages to break out of an application running as root in a container, they may be able to gain access to the host with the same root user. Configuring containers to use unprivileged users, is the best way to prevent privilege escalation attacks. If you wish to learn more, the follow article offers some detailed explanation examples of what happens when you run your containers as root . Limit capabilities # Linux capabilities give processes the ability to do some of the many privileged operations only the root user can do by default. For example, CAP_CHOWN allows a process to \"make arbitrary changes to file UIDs and GIDs\". Even if your process doesn't run as root , there's a chance that a process could use those root-like features by escalating privileges. In other words, you should enable only the capabilities that you need if you don't want to be compromised. But what capabilities should be enabled and why? The following two articles dive into the theory and practical best-practices about capabilities in the Linux Kernel: Linux Capabilities: Why They Exist and How They Work Linux Capabilities In Practice Prevent privilege escalation # You should run your container with privilege escalation turned off to prevent escalating privileges using setuid or setgid binaries. containers can talk to any other container in the network , and there's no translation of addresses in the process \u2014 i.e. no NAT is involved nodes in the cluster can talk to any other container in the network and vice-versa . Even in this case, there's no translation of addresses \u2014 i.e. no NAT a container's IP address is always the same , independently if seen from another container or itself. The first rule isn't helping if you plan to segregate your cluster in smaller chunks and have isolation between namespaces. Imagine if a user in your cluster were able to use any other service in the cluster. Now, imagine if a malicious user in the cluster were to obtain access to the cluster \u2014 they could make requests to the whole cluster. To fix that, you can define how Pods should be allowed to communicate in the current namespace and cross-namespace using Network Policies. Enable network policies # Kubernetes network policies specify the access permissions for groups of pods, much like security groups in the cloud are used to control access to VM instances. In other words, it creates firewalls between pods running on a Kubernetes cluster. If you are not familiar with Network Policies, you can read Securing Kubernetes Cluster Networking . There's a conservative NetworkPolicy in every namespace # Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies # It's common practice to give away the least permission needed, but what is practical and how do you quantify the least privilege? Fine-grained policies provide greater security but require more effort to administrate. Broader grants can give unnecessary API access to service accounts but are easier to controls. Should you create a single policy per namespace and share it? Or perhaps it's better to have them on a more granular basis? There's no one-size-fits-all approach, and you should judge your requirements case by case. But where do you start? If you start with a Role with empty rules, you can add all the resources that you need one by one and still be sure that you're not giving away too much. Disable auto-mounting of the default ServiceAccount # Please note that the default ServiceAccount is automatically mounted into the file system of all Pods . You might want to disable that and provide more granular policies. RBAC policies are set to the least amount of privileges necessary # It's challenging to find good advice on how to set up your RBAC rules. In 3 realistic approaches to Kubernetes RBAC, you can find three practical scenarios and practical advice on how to get started. RBAC policies are granular and not shared # Zalando has a concise policy to define roles and ServiceAccounts. First, they describe their requirements: Users should be able to deploy, but they shouldn't be allowed to read Secrets for example Admins should get full access to all resources Applications should not gain write access to the Kubernetes API by default It should be possible to write to the Kubernetes API for some uses. The four requirements translate into five separate Roles: ReadOnly PowerUser Operator Controller Admin You can read about their decision in this link . Custom Policies # As an example, you might want to avoid downloading containers from the public internet and prefer to approve those containers first. Perhaps you have an internal registry, and only the images in this registry can be deployed in your cluster. How do you enforce that only trusted containers can be deployed in the cluster? There's no RBAC policy for that. Network policies won't work. What should you do? You could use the Admission controller to vet resources that are submitted to the cluster. Allow deploying containers only from known registries # One of the most common custom policies that you might want to consider is to restrict the images that can be deployed in your cluster. The following tutorial explains how you can use the Open Policy Agent to restrict not approved images . Enforce uniqueness in Ingress hostnames # When a user creates an Ingress manifest, they can use any hostname in it. ingress.yaml apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: Ingress metadata: name: example-ingress spec: rules: - host: first.example.com http: paths: - path: / pathType: Prefix backend: service: name: service port: number: 80 However, you might want to prevent users using the same hostname multiple times and overriding each other. The official documentation for the Open Policy Agent has a tutorial on how to check Ingress resources as part of the validation webhook . Only use approved domain names in the Ingress hostnames # When a user creates an Ingress manifest, they can use any hostname in it. a ingress.yaml apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: Ingress metadata: name: example-ingress spec: rules: - host: first.example.com http: paths: - path: / pathType: Prefix backend: service: name: service port: number: 80 However, you might want to prevent users using invalid hostnames . The official documentation for the Open Policy Agent has a tutorial on how to check Ingress resources as part of the validation webhook . 3. Cluster configuration # This section is a work in progress. Do you have an opinion on what you should be included? File an issue. Approved Kubernetes configuration But how do you know what's the recommended configuration for your cluster? The best option is to compare your cluster with a standard reference. In the case of Kubernetes, the reference is the Centre for Internet Security (CIS) benchmark. The cluster passes the CIS benchmark # The Center for Internet Security provides several guidelines and benchmark tests for best practices in securing your code. They also maintain a benchmark for Kubernetes which you can download from the official website . While you can read the lengthy guide and manually check if your cluster is compliant, an easier way is to download and execute kube-bench . kube-bench is a tool designed to automate the CIS Kubernetes benchmark and report on misconfigurations in your cluster. Example output: [ INFO ] 1 Master Node Security Configuration [ INFO ] 1 .1 API Server [ WARN ] 1 .1.1 Ensure that the --anonymous-auth argument is set to false ( Not Scored ) [ PASS ] 1 .1.2 Ensure that the --basic-auth-file argument is not set ( Scored ) [ PASS ] 1 .1.3 Ensure that the --insecure-allow-any-token argument is not set ( Not Scored ) [ PASS ] 1 .1.4 Ensure that the --kubelet-https argument is set to true ( Scored ) [ PASS ] 1 .1.5 Ensure that the --insecure-bind-address argument is not set ( Scored ) [ PASS ] 1 .1.6 Ensure that the --insecure-port argument is set to 0 ( Scored ) [ PASS ] 1 .1.7 Ensure that the --secure-port argument is not set to 0 ( Scored ) [ FAIL ] 1 .1.8 Ensure that the --profiling argument is set to false ( Scored ) Please note that it is not possible to inspect the master nodes of managed clusters such as GKE, EKS and AKS, using kube-bench . The master nodes are controlled and managed by the cloud provider. Disable metadata cloud providers metada API # Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCE, etc.) often expose metadata services locally to instances. By default, these APIs are accessible by pods running on an instance and can contain cloud credentials for that node, or provisioning data such as kubelet credentials. These credentials can be used to escalate within the cluster or to other cloud services under the same account. Restrict access to alpha or beta features # Alpha and beta Kubernetes features are in active development and may have limitations or bugs that result in security vulnerabilities. Always assess the value an alpha or beta feature may provide against the possible risk to your security posture. When in doubt, disable features you do not use. Kubernetes supports different authentication strategies: Static Tokens : are difficult to invalidate and should be avoided Bootstrap Tokens : same as static tokens above Basic Authentication transmits credentials over the network in cleartext X509 client certs requires renewing and redistributing client certs regularly Service Account Tokens are the preferred authentication strategy for applications and workloads running in the cluster OpenID Connect (OIDC) Tokens : best authentication strategy for end-users as OIDC integrates with your identity provider such as AD, AWS IAM, GCP IAM, etc. You can learn about the strategies in more detail in the official documentation . Use OpenID (OIDC) tokens as a user authentication strategy # Kubernetes supports various authentication methods, including OpenID Connect (OIDC). OpenID Connect allows single sign-on (SSO) such as your Google Identity to connect to a Kubernetes cluster and other development tools. You don't need to remember or manage credentials separately. You could have several clusters connect to the same OpenID provider. You can learn more about the OpenID connect in Kubernetes in this article. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) ServiceAccount tokens are for applications and controllers only # Service Account Tokens should not be used for end-users trying to interact with Kubernetes clusters, but they are the preferred authentication strategy for applications and workloads running on Kubernetes. There's a retention and archival strategy for logs # You should retain 30-45 days of historical logs. Logs are collected from Nodes, Control Plane, Auditing # What to collect logs from: Nodes (kubelet, container runtime) Control plane (API server, scheduler, controller manager) Kubernetes auditing (all requests to the API server) What you should collect: Application name. Retrieved from metadata labels. Application instance. Retrieved from metadata labels. Application version. Retrieved from metadata labels. Cluster ID. Retrieved from Kubernetes cluster.

The Cluster Autoscaler can automatically scale the size of your cluster by adding or removing worker nodes. A scale-up operation happens when a Pod fails to be scheduled because of insufficient resources on the existing worker nodes. In this case, the Cluster Autoscaler creates a new worker node, so that the Pod can be scheduled. Similarly, when the utilisation of the existing worker nodes is low, the Cluster Autoscaler can scale down by evicting all the workloads from one of the worker nodes and removing it. Using the Cluster Autoscaler makes sense for highly variable workloads, for example, when the number of Pods may multiply in a short time, and then go back to the previous value. In such scenarios, the Cluster Autoscaler allows you to meet the demand spikes without wasting resources by overprovisioning worker nodes. However, if your workloads do not vary so much, it may not be worth to set up the Cluster Autoscaler, as it may never be triggered. If your workloads grow slowly and monotonically, it may be enough to monitor the utilisations of your existing worker nodes and add an additional worker node manually when they reach a critical value.

Logging in code Modern programming languages come with logging packages that allow you to add lines of text to a log file as the application is running. Taking advantage of these packages will give you a papertrail of what your application is doing as users interact with it. Smart use of logging will allow you to spot bugs in your code, diagnose incorrect behavior in your application, troubleshoot user issuers, and raise alerts when cyber-attacks occur. Key Elements in Log Statements Each entry written to a log file should contain a timestamp, the log message, and an indication of where in the code the entry is being written from - in other words, the code file and line number. Depending on what type of functionality the code is handling, it is also useful to include some of the following: The server name if more than one server is writing to the log file. The URL, HTTP status code and incoming IP address if the code is handling an incoming HTTP request. The username if the code is being executed in response to an action by a logged-in user. Timing information if the code is executing a time-sensitive action. Diagnostic information - for instance, if any action had to re-tried, or if a component is responding slowly. Error messages and stack traces if an error occurs. What Events to Log You should log every HTTP request and the corresponding response, being sure to include the URL, the HTTP response code, and the time taken to service the request. You should also log any significant actions performed by your web application, including: Input validation failures, e.g. when the code encounters unexpected parameter names or values. Authentication successes and failures. Authorization (access control) failures. Session management failures, e.g. when session cookies are rejected as invalid. Application errors and system events. Startup and shutdown events - including timing information! User events like sign-ups, password changes and account deletions. Administrative events, e.g. when permissions are changed by an admin. Calls to third-party services or APIs. Legal and other opt-ins, e.g. when a user accepts the terms of use. Log Levels By convention, most logging packages allow you to mark logging statements with one of at least four \u201clog levels\u201d - typically named DEBUG, INFO, WARNING and ERROR, in order of importance. You should mark each logging statement with an appropriate log level to make it easy to filter out the noise in log files. Servers can be configured so only statements marked with a particular log level are written to the log file: a server configured with the INFO log-level will write INFO, WARNING and ERROR messages to the log file, but omit DEBUG messages. Low-level diagnostic events should be marked as DEBUG statements, and typically only show up in non-production environments. The INFO log level should be used for normal running: the events expected to occur when users interact with your website. Unexpected events should be logged with the WARNING level, and errors should be marked with the ERROR log level. Make sure your team has access to these logs too when diagnosing issues. In addition to the logging statements added to your code, other applications in your stack will typically output log files. A web server like Apache, Nginx or IIS will log HTTP request and response information. Databases will typically write log files too, which are useful for diagnosing performance issues. log aggregation and storage Logs should be centralized and stored securely so they can be viewed by administrators. \u201cLog servers\u201d like LogStash, Graylog, Splunk and PaperTrail will aggregate log files from different sources and allow them to be searched and analyzed in realtime. Log servers are often available as services, and can be added as plug-ins if you run on cloud-based services. monitoring is paired with logging The process of continuously assessing whether your site is running as expected. Monitoring software often pulls key \u201cmetrics\u201d from log files to diagnose the health of a web application. Let\u2019s discuss the various ways you can monitor your application. Uptime Monitoring is in place The most basic form of monitoring is checking that your site is available. \u201cUptime monitors\u201d like Uptime Robot and Pingdom are free services that will check whether a URL is responding to HTTP requests successfully. (More complex or frequent checks are usually available as a paid option.) This is a simple way to achieve peace-of-mind: if your site ever becomes unavailable, the monitoring software will send an email or text alert to your team. Error Reporting Capturing unexpected errors that occur on your website is key to detecting cyber-attacks and ensuring software quality. Errors conditions can either be extracted from log files, or recorded using plug-ins provided by services like Rollbar or Airbrake. Error reporting services even allow you to capture error conditions that occur in JavaScript in the browser, which typically won\u2019t appear in server-side logs. Performance Metrics Capturing performance metrics will give you granular information about the state of your web application. Your monitoring should keep track of: Responsiveness: how long it takes to respond to each web request. Throughput: how many requests per second are hitting your site. Memory usage and server load: how much of each server\u2019s memory space is being used up, and how close each server is to full capacity. Database performance: how many queries are being run per second and how many concurrent connections there are. Alerting You should configure your monitoring software to alert your team when unusual errors occur or when performance metrics reach critical conditions. Alerts can be sent over email, instant messaging or text. Large organizations will have support rotas, so at least one engineer is available to respond to alerts at all times. Response Plans Being alerted to errors is only useful if there are actions your support engineers can undertake to fix the error condition! Make sure you put together a trouble-shooting plan for a responding engineer to follow, and keep it up to date as you develop your system. Troubleshooting steps may consist of restarting servers, adding extra servers in times of high load, blacklisting IP addresses when you see malicious traffic, or escalating to team specialists (like network engineers and database administrators) when particular parts of the application appear to be the problem. If the issue starts to affect users, making an announcement on a status page or in a website banner will earn you goodwill. What Not to Log Writing sensitive information to your logs is a security risk - imagine what an attacker could do if they stole your log files! Make sure your logging statements never contain any of the following: User or system passwords. Encryption keys. Database connection strings. API keys for third-party services. Personally identifiable information about users. Payment information like credit card numbers. Sensitive HTTP headers, such as Authorization headers. Session IDs or session cookies. Access tokens - for example, those used during sign-ups or password resets. Information a user has opted out of collection. The \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d is law in many parts of the world, and this includes data in log files.","title":"monitorin readiness lists"},{"location":"devops/check-lists/monitoring-list/#monitoring-check-list","text":"Logging in code Modern programming languages come with logging packages that allow you to add lines of text to a log file as the application is running.

In addition to the logging statements added to your code, other applications in your stack will typically output log files. A web server like Apache, Nginx or IIS will log HTTP request and response information. Databases will typically write log files too, which are useful for diagnosing performance issues. log aggregation and storage Logs should be centralized and stored securely so they can be viewed by administrators. \u201cLog servers\u201d like LogStash, Graylog, Splunk and PaperTrail will aggregate log files from different sources and allow them to be searched and analyzed in realtime. Log servers are often available as services, and can be added as plug-ins if you run on cloud-based services. monitoring is paired with logging The process of continuously assessing whether your site is running as expected. Monitoring software often pulls key \u201cmetrics\u201d from log files to diagnose the health of a web application. Let\u2019s discuss the various ways you can monitor your application. Uptime Monitoring is in place The most basic form of monitoring is checking that your site is available. \u201cUptime monitors\u201d like Uptime Robot and Pingdom are free services that will check whether a URL is responding to HTTP requests successfully. (More complex or frequent checks are usually available as a paid option.) This is a simple way to achieve peace-of-mind: if your site ever becomes unavailable, the monitoring software will send an email or text alert to your team. Error Reporting Capturing unexpected errors that occur on your website is key to detecting cyber-attacks and ensuring software quality. Errors conditions can either be extracted from log files, or recorded using plug-ins provided by services like Rollbar or Airbrake. Error reporting services even allow you to capture error conditions that occur in JavaScript in the browser, which typically won\u2019t appear in server-side logs. Performance Metrics Capturing performance metrics will give you granular information about the state of your web application. Your monitoring should keep track of: Responsiveness: how long it takes to respond to each web request. Throughput: how many requests per second are hitting your site. Memory usage and server load: how much of each server\u2019s memory space is being used up, and how close each server is to full capacity. Database performance: how many queries are being run per second and how many concurrent connections there are. Alerting You should configure your monitoring software to alert your team when unusual errors occur or when performance metrics reach critical conditions. Alerts can be sent over email, instant messaging or text. Large organizations will have support rotas, so at least one engineer is available to respond to alerts at all times. Response Plans Being alerted to errors is only useful if there are actions your support engineers can undertake to fix the error condition! Make sure you put together a trouble-shooting plan for a responding engineer to follow, and keep it up to date as you develop your system. Troubleshooting steps may consist of restarting servers, adding extra servers in times of high load, blacklisting IP addresses when you see malicious traffic, or escalating to team specialists (like network engineers and database administrators) when particular parts of the application appear to be the problem. If the issue starts to affect users, making an announcement on a status page or in a website banner will earn you goodwill. What Not to Log Writing sensitive information to your logs is a security risk - imagine what an attacker could do if they stole your log files! Make sure your logging statements never contain any of the following: User or system passwords. Encryption keys. Database connection strings. API keys for third-party services. Personally identifiable information about users. Payment information like credit card numbers. Sensitive HTTP headers, such as Authorization headers. Session IDs or session cookies. Access tokens - for example, those used during sign-ups or password resets. Information a user has opted out of collection. The \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d is law in many parts of the world, and this includes data in log files.","title":"Monitoring Check List"},{"location":"devops/check-lists/operations-metrics/","tags":["checklist","architecture","metrics","ops","operations"],"text":"If you want to take DevOps to the next level, get our list of DevOps metrics to help you track and improve.

Compute Abstractions Diagram # I was trying to find a way to explain, in the easiest way possible, all the options the platform offers to our users from a compute perspective. There are of course many ways to peal this onion and I wanted to create a \u201cvisual story\u201d that was easy for me to tell. The compute domain as \"anything that has CPU and Memory capacity that allows you to run an arbitrary piece of code written in a specific programming language\". It goes without saying that your mileage may vary in how you define it but this is a broad enough definition that should cover a lot of different interpretations. Use Case # The reason for which the line above is oblique, is because it needs to intercept different compute abstraction levels. If you think about what happened in the last 20 years of IT, we have seen a surge of different compute abstractions that have changed the way people consume CPU and Memory resources. It all started with physical (x86) servers back in the eighties and then we have seen the industry adding a number of abstraction layers over the years (i.e. hypervisors, containers, functions). As you can depict from the graphic below, the higher you go in the abstraction levels, the more the cloud provider can add value and can offload the consumer from non-strategic activities. A lot of these activities tend to be \u201cundifferentiated heavy lifting\u201d. Questions to Address # Some customers were (and still are) happy about being in full control of said instances. Are you one of them? Useful components in this diagram # The bare metal abstraction - Also known as the \u201cno abstraction\u201d. The instance (or virtual machine) abstraction - (Amazon EC2) is the service that allows AWS customers to launch instances in the cloud. When customers intercept the platform at this level, they retain responsibility of the guest Operating System and above (middleware, applications etc.) and their life-cycle. Similarly, customers leave to AWS the responsibility for managing the hardware and the hypervisor including their life-cycle. The container abstraction - In a nutshell, you can think of a container as a self-contained environment with soft boundaries that includes both your own application as well as the software dependencies to run it. Whereas an instance (or VM) virtualizes a piece of hardware so that you can run dedicated operating systems, a container technology virtualizes an operating system so that you can run separated applications with different (and often incompatible) software dependencies. The full container abstraction (for lack of a better term) - Practically speaking, Fargate is making the containers data plane fall into the \"Provider space\" responsibility. This means the compute unit exposed to the user is the container abstraction, while AWS will manage transparently the data plane abstractions underneath. The function abstraction - In the context of this blog post, the key point about Lambda is that you don\u2019t have to manage the infrastructure underneath the function you are running. No need to track the status of the physical hosts, no need to track the capacity of the fleet, no need to patch the OS where the function will be running. In a nutshell, no need to spend time and money on the undifferentiated heavy lifting.","title":"application documentation checklist"},{"location":"devops/check-lists/technical-diagrams-checklist/#technical-architecture-diagrams","text":"A technical architecture diagram provides a bird\u2019s eye view of the infrastructure of your organisation.

If you think about what happened in the last 20 years of IT, we have seen a surge of different compute abstractions that have changed the way people consume CPU and Memory resources. It all started with physical (x86) servers back in the eighties and then we have seen the industry adding a number of abstraction layers over the years (i.e. hypervisors, containers, functions). As you can depict from the graphic below, the higher you go in the abstraction levels, the more the cloud provider can add value and can offload the consumer from non-strategic activities. A lot of these activities tend to be \u201cundifferentiated heavy lifting\u201d.","title":"Use Case"},{"location":"devops/check-lists/technical-diagrams-checklist/#questions-to-address_5","text":"Some customers were (and still are) happy about being in full control of said instances.

The instance (or virtual machine) abstraction - (Amazon EC2) is the service that allows AWS customers to launch instances in the cloud. When customers intercept the platform at this level, they retain responsibility of the guest Operating System and above (middleware, applications etc.) and their life-cycle. Similarly, customers leave to AWS the responsibility for managing the hardware and the hypervisor including their life-cycle. The container abstraction - In a nutshell, you can think of a container as a self-contained environment with soft boundaries that includes both your own application as well as the software dependencies to run it. Whereas an instance (or VM) virtualizes a piece of hardware so that you can run dedicated operating systems, a container technology virtualizes an operating system so that you can run separated applications with different (and often incompatible) software dependencies. The full container abstraction (for lack of a better term) - Practically speaking, Fargate is making the containers data plane fall into the \"Provider space\" responsibility. This means the compute unit exposed to the user is the container abstraction, while AWS will manage transparently the data plane abstractions underneath. The function abstraction - In the context of this blog post, the key point about Lambda is that you don\u2019t have to manage the infrastructure underneath the function you are running. No need to track the status of the physical hosts, no need to track the capacity of the fleet, no need to patch the OS where the function will be running. In a nutshell, no need to spend time and money on the undifferentiated heavy lifting.","title":"Useful components in this diagram"},{"location":"devops/check-lists/vault-checklist/","tags":["checklist","vault","best practices","readiness","hashicorp"],"text":"Vault production checklist # Managing secrets is a challenge. When it comes to Vault, there are many options to design your security architecture. Along with the right secret management design in mind, you\u2019ll also need to consider a properly configured Vault service. Since Vault is a central point of truth for your credentials, it takes some effort to configure it rightly. Basically, in production, you\u2019ll need to properly manage 2 main separate services: Vault and Vault\u2019s Backend Storage. In this article, we\u2019ll go through all requirements of the production-ready Vault deployment. Setting up & maintaining Vault # TLS connection. Regardless of your environment you always need to configure Vault to use SSL certificates. Moreover, if you\u2019re using a load balancer or a proxy, you shouldn\u2019t terminate the SSL connection to the Vault service. Make sure to provision and update Vault\u2019s SSL certificates in time. High Availability. In a production environment where microservices rely on a centralized secret store, it is critical to avoid downtime and make this store reliable. There are a number of backends that can be used in conjunction with Vault to create a Highly Available service. Auto-Unseal. This requirement is strongly related to the previous one. Vault starts in a \u2018sealed\u2019 state. Since version 1.0, Vault has an auto-unseal feature that is based on cloud services: Amazon KMS, Azure Key Vault, AliCloud KMS, and Google Cloud KMS. Consider creating a proper cloud policy to grant Vault permissions to use the appropriate KMS. Load Balancer configuration. It is important to note that you need to configure your Load Balancer to route traffic only to \u201chealthy\u201d Vault replicas. As we said earlier, once the Vault has started, it has a \u201csealed\u201d state. You need to keep in mind that in HA mode your replicas will have separate states. And if one replica restarts, it would take some time for auto-unseal to perform. Make sure that your load balancer checks if the replica is in the \u201cunsealed\u201d state before routing the traffic to it. Vault upgrade strategy. Vault is actively developed by the community and new versions are released frequently. It is critical to minimize the risks and upgrade Vault regularly along with new bug and security fixes. In the HA mode, you need to pay attention to the upgrade strategy. Each node must be stopped gracefully one-by-one starting from the active node. This will guarantee that the data won\u2019t be corrupted or lost. Underlying infrastructure upgrade strategy. Vault is always run on top of the operating system. The underlying infrastructure is run on Bare metal, VM or containers. Unfortunately, all of these options can have potential undiscovered vulnerabilities. Always have a strategy to upgrade your underlying software and avoid critical issues. Firewall configuration. Regardless of the environments, one of the most powerful ways to secure your Vault service is to restrict traffic from untrusted sources. The outgoing Vault traffic must be restricted as well. If it is possible, configure your underlying firewall to allow traffic only from your applications and services that need to connect to Vault. Linux as the main OS. While Vault can be run on different operating systems, the official Hashicorp recommendation is simple and straightforward: use Linux. The reason for this is that Vault\u2019s source code is optimized to use Linux kernel API to manage memory access securely. SSH access. The node that is running Vault must be only accessed by the Vault API. Avoid exposing any RPC access to the underlying infrastructure. The information about the Vault service can be accessed using the Audit and Telemetry data. Auditing. Vault supports special audit logs that trace in detail how the service was queried. These logs are disabled by default for simplicity, but in production systems, it is highly recommended to enable it. Vault can be configured to write audit logs into multiple \u201caudit devices\u201d: File, Syslog, and Socket. There is one critical pitfall regarding Vault\u2019s auditing mechanism that is often overlooked by newcomers: If you have only one audit device enabled, and it is blocking (network block, etc.), then Vault will be unresponsive. Vault will not complete any requests until the audit device can write. In production, it is recommended to use multiple devices at once to mitigate the risks of unresponsive Vault service. As we restrict the access to Vault nodes, it is a good practice to send audit logs into a separate log aggregation system, e.g. ELK. Isolated process. Consider running Vault as a single process on the system. You can isolate your service using a VM or a container. The official Hashicorp infrastructure priority is the following: Bare metal > VMs > Containers. Make sure that there are no other separate processes that can be compromised to corrupt the Vault process. Disable Swap & Core Dumps. Even the Vault is a stateless service\u200a\u2014\u200athere is some sensitive data that is being kept in memory. Keeping this in mind, it is highly recommended to configure the underlying operating system to disable swap. This will reduce the risk of cashing sensitive data to disk. Along with swap, it is recommended to turn off core dumps to disable access to the Vault\u2019s internal memory by users and processes. Telemetry. Hashicorp products often expose the telemetry interface, and Vault is not an exception. Vault delivers a variety of useful metrics about itself. In production, it is useful to track the performance of your Backend Storage operations. Vault can be configured to send the metrics to the particular upstream service, e.g. StatsD . Setting up & maintaining Storage Backend # One of the underlying challenges in a production-ready Vault service is to manage the Vault\u2019s storage backend. Regardless of your storage engine choice, there are requirements that must be fulfilled: Reliability. If your storage backend crashes, the Vault service will be unreachable too. Along with Vault, the storage backend must implement the High Availability pattern. Security. The data in backend storage is always encrypted by Vault but if the storage is compromised\u200a\u2014\u200athe data can be corrupted. Make sure that the storage backend can only be accessed by Vault. Backup & Recovery. Prevent situations of data corruption or loss. Implement the backup and recovery strategy for your storage. Upgrades. Some supported storages are distributed as open source software. Along with Vault, this software should be upgraded to minimize potential risks. Rockos Managed Vault # If you\u2019re struggling to implement the Vault production checklist then you can simply use the Managed Vault solution by the Rockos team. It takes a lot of effort to manage both Vault and Backend Storage properly. We believe that people should focus on using Vault but not managing it.

martym, agoogler Status : Complete, action items in progress Summary : Shakespeare Search down for 66 minutes during period of very high interest in Shakespeare due to discovery of a new sonnet. Impact : 163 Estimated 1.21B queries lost, no revenue impact. Root Causes : 164 Cascading failure due to combination of exceptionally high load and a resource leak when searches failed due to terms not being in the Shakespeare corpus. The newly discovered sonnet used a word that had never before appeared in one of Shakespeare\u2019s works, which happened to be the term users searched for. Under normal circumstances, the rate of task failures due to resource leaks is low enough to be unnoticed. Trigger : Latent bug triggered by sudden increase in traffic. Resolution : Directed traffic to sacrificial cluster and added 10x capacity to mitigate cascading failure. Updated index deployed, resolving interaction with latent bug. Maintaining extra capacity until surge in public interest in new sonnet passes. Resource leak identified and fix deployed. Detection : Borgmon detected high level of HTTP 500s and paged on-call. Action Items : 165 Action Item Type Owner Bug Update playbook with instructions for responding to cascading failure mitigate jennifer n/a DONE Use flux capacitor to balance load between clusters prevent martym Bug 5554823 TODO Schedule cascading failure test during next DiRT process docbrown n/a TODO Investigate running index MR/fusion continuously prevent jennifer Bug 5554824 TODO Plug file descriptor leak in search ranking subsystem prevent agoogler Bug 5554825 DONE Add load shedding capabilities to Shakespeare search prevent agoogler Bug 5554826 TODO Build regression tests to ensure servers respond sanely to queries of death prevent clarac Bug 5554827 TODO Deploy updated search ranking subsystem to prod prevent jennifer n/a DONE Freeze production until 2015-11-20 due to error budget exhaustion, or seek exception due to grotesque, unbelievable, bizarre, and unprecedented circumstances other docbrown n/a TODO What went well Monitoring quickly alerted us to high rate (reaching ~100%) of HTTP 500s Rapidly distributed updated Shakespeare corpus to all clusters What went wrong We\u2019re out of practice in responding to cascading failure We exceeded our availability error budget (by several orders of magnitude) due to the exceptional surge of traffic that essentially all resulted in failures Where we got lucky 166 Mailing list of Shakespeare aficionados had a copy of new sonnet available Server logs had stack traces pointing to file descriptor exhaustion as cause for crash Query-of-death was resolved by pushing new index containing popular search term 2015-10-21 (all times UTC) 14:51 News reports that a new Shakespearean sonnet has been discovered in a Delorean\u2019s glove compartment 14:53 Traffic to Shakespeare search increases by 88x after post to /r/shakespeare points to Shakespeare search engine as place to find new sonnet (except we don\u2019t have the sonnet yet) 14:54 OUTAGE BEGINS \u2014 Search backends start melting down under load 14:55 docbrown receives pager storm, ManyHttp500s from all clusters 14:57 All traffic to Shakespeare search is failing: see https://monitor 14:58 docbrown starts investigating, finds backend crash rate very high 15:01 INCIDENT BEGINS docbrown declares incident #465 due to cascading failure, coordination on #shakespeare , names jennifer incident commander 15:02 someone coincidentally sends email to shakespeare-discuss@ re sonnet discovery, which happens to be at top of martym\u2019s inbox 15:03 jennifer notifies shakespeare-incidents@ list of the incident 15:04 martym tracks down text of new sonnet and looks for documentation on corpus update 15:06 docbrown finds that crash symptoms identical across all tasks in all clusters, investigating cause based on application logs 15:07 martym finds documentation, starts prep work for corpus update 15:10 martym adds sonnet to Shakespeare\u2019s known works, starts indexing job 15:12 docbrown contacts clarac & agoogler (from Shakespeare dev team) to help with examining codebase for possible causes 15:18 clarac finds smoking gun in logs pointing to file descriptor exhaustion, confirms against code that leak exists if term not in corpus is searched for 15:20 martym\u2019s index MapReduce job completes 15:21 jennifer and docbrown decide to increase instance count enough to drop load on instances that they\u2019re able to do appreciable work before dying and being restarted 15:23 docbrown load balances all traffic to USA-2 cluster, permitting instance count increase in other clusters without servers failing immediately 15:25 martym starts replicating new index to all clusters 15:28 docbrown starts 2x instance count increase 15:32 jennifer changes load balancing to increase traffic to nonsacrificial clusters 15:33 tasks in nonsacrificial clusters start failing, same symptoms as before 15:34 found order-of-magnitude error in whiteboard calculations for instance count increase 15:36 jennifer reverts load balancing to resacrifice USA-2 cluster in preparation for additional global 5x instance count increase (to a total of 10x initial capacity) 15:36 OUTAGE MITIGATED , updated index replicated to all clusters 15:39 docbrown starts second wave of instance count increase to 10x initial capacity 15:41 jennifer reinstates load balancing across all clusters for 1% of traffic 15:43 nonsacrificial clusters\u2019 HTTP 500 rates at nominal rates, task failures intermittent at low levels 15:45 jennifer balances 10% of traffic across nonsacrificial clusters 15:47 nonsacrificial clusters\u2019 HTTP 500 rates remain within SLO, no task failures observed 15:50 30% of traffic balanced across nonsacrificial clusters 15:55 50% of traffic balanced across nonsacrificial clusters 16:00 OUTAGE ENDS , all traffic balanced across all clusters 16:30 INCIDENT ENDS , reached exit criterion of 30 minutes\u2019 nominal performance Monitoring dashboard, https://monitor/shakespeare?end _time=20151021T160000 &duration=7200","title":"Google -

The incident will also have an affected infrastructure section where you can pick components of the GitLab.com application and the underlying services/containers should we have an incident due to a provider. You can update incidents with the Update Status button on an existing incident, again you can tweet, etc from that update point. Remember to close out the incident when the issue is resolved.

Generating a new runbooks image # To generate a new image you must follow the git commit guidelines below, this will trigger a semantic version bump which will then cause a new pipeline that will build and tag the new image Git Commit Guidelines # This project uses Semantic Versioning . We use commit messages to automatically determine the version bumps, so they should adhere to the conventions of Conventional Commits (v1.0.0-beta.2) . TL;DR # Commit messages starting with fix: trigger a patch version bump Commit messages starting with feat: trigger a minor version bump Commit messages starting with BREAKING CHANGE: trigger a major version bump. If you don't want to publish a new image, do not use the above starting strings. Automatic versioning # Each push to master triggers a semantic-release CI job that determines and pushes a new version tag (if any) based on the last version tagged and the new commits pushed. Notice that this means that if a Merge Request contains, for example, several feat: commits, only one minor version bump will occur on merge. If your Merge Request includes several commits you may prefer to ignore the prefix on each individual commit and instead add an empty commit summarizing your changes like so: git commit --allow-empty -m '[BREAKING CHANGE|feat|fix]: <changelog summary message>' Tool Versioning # This project has adopted adsf version-manager for tool versioning. Installation instructions for asdf can be found at https://asdf-vm.com/#/core-manage-asdf-vm?id=install . For compatibility, please configure the following line in ~/.asdfrc legacy_version_file = yes Dependencies and required tooling # Following tools and libraries are required to develop dashboards locally: Go programming langugage Ruby programming language go-jsonnet - Jsonnet implementation written in Go jsonnet-bunder - package manager for Jsonnet jq - command line JSON processor You can install most of them using asdf tool. Manage your dependencies using asdf # Our asdf toolset uses the following plugins: golang : asdf plugin add golang ruby : asdf plugin add ruby go-jsonnet : asdf plugin add go-jsonnet . jsonnet-bundler : asdf plugin add jb . Once you have installed these plugins, run the following command to install the required versions. $ asdf install go-jsonnet 0.16.0 is already installed golang 1.14 is already installed ruby 2.6.5 is already installed $ # Confirm everything is working with.... $ asdf current go-jsonnet 0.16.0 (set by ~/runbooks/.tool-versions) golang 1.14 (set by ~/runbooks/.tool-versions) ruby 2.6.5 (set by ~/runbooks/.ruby-version) You don't need to use asdf , but in such case you will need install all dependencies manually and track their versions. Go, Jsonnet # We use .tool-versions to record the version of go-jsonnet that should be used for local development. The asdf version manager is used by some team members to automatically switch versions based on the contents of this file. It should be kept up to date. The top-level Dockerfile contains the version of go-jsonnet we use in CI. This should be kept in sync with .tool-versions , and a (non-gating) CI job enforces this. To install go-jsonnet , you have a few options. You could follow that project's README to install manually; Or via homebrew: brew install go-jsonnet Or if you're using asdf , you can use an asdf plugin . Ruby # Additional to adsf , many developers use rbenv , rvm or other tooling, so, for convenience, we maintain the standard .ruby-version file for the Ruby version. ASDF needs to be configured using the legacy_version_file = yes setting described in the parent section .

Make your job easier and don\u2019t. It\u2019s terribly difficult to manage unmotivated people. Make your job easier and don\u2019t. Different people need different kinds of management. Be adaptable to figure out what drives each person\u2019s best performance. Give feedback frequently and directly. As a manager, it\u2019s easier to wait and then hedge critical feedback in soft wrappers, but that\u2019s selfish. I\u2019d try to give feedback as soon as I could grab a conference room with the person, and not wait until the formal 1:1 days later. A-players love hearing critical feedback about how they\u2019re performing, and they hate when B-players don\u2019t hear feedback of their own. Keep your A-players happy by providing actionable feedback to everyone and recognizing superior performance. Communication is the most difficult thing you\u2019ll do. Spend a lot of time on it, both on your own communication and improving the communication of the folks on your team. Fire quickly. If you don\u2019t fire bad performers fast, you\u2019re at risk of losing your good performers. Don\u2019t underestimate the effect bad performers have on good performers. Your team will likely move faster even with fewer bodies. Finally, firing for bad performance is easier than having to fire good people because you\u2019ve run out of money, so fire the bad people before you have to fire the good people too. People need to feel like they\u2019ve been listened to, not to make the final call. Take the time to listen (you might be wrong), make a decision and then explain the decision. Don\u2019t offer commentary on others\u2019 decisions until you understand why the decisions were made. Providing context for why you made a decision is a way to scale your decision-making process. The goal is for the manager to make as few decisions as possible, and to do this, your team needs to understand how to make good decisions. Define success clearly and don\u2019t flip-flop on the definition without new information. On the other hand, when the facts change, re-evaluate your goals. Set achievable but difficult targets. Hiring friends can be very useful because communication will be easier, and your friends are probably smart and talented. But you might do so at the cost of hiring for things like experience or domain-expertise. If you can\u2019t fire friends, don\u2019t hire them. Mission-oriented teams are a competitive advantage because they make it easier to 1) hire and 2) motivate. Any action taken between a manager and an individual (a promotion, more frequent 1:1's, a call out in a meeting) is not just between the manager and the individual, but affects every person on the team. For example, if you promote one person, make sure the rest of the team understands why that person was promoted and what needs to be done to achieve the same. You\u2019re more likely to lose by not recognizing your weaknesses than from the presence of weakness, so aim for self-awareness. Sometimes you\u2019ll have to bet on big, resource intensive projects that won\u2019t work. Be careful of the morale toll on your team. Not everyone has great tolerance for repeated failure. If you\u2019re a founder, you probably are more used to this than your team. One technique is to mix iterative work with riskier bigger bets to rebuild this energy. But you should also try to not paint any feature as a silver bullet, and individual failure in good faith as a necessary cost of trying new things. Your company is a portfolio bet. How you spend money is one of the biggest cultural signals you can send and is very hard to change. Where you spend money (and where you don\u2019t) communicates what you think is important. The best way to avoid politics isn\u2019t to ignore politics, but to spend your time on it. Define clear merit-based systems, which reduces confusion about what your team members need to do be recognized. One of the most helpful things you can do is remind the team of the bigger picture. Knowing what\u2019s important will help cut through the bullshit. The best way to manage great people is to provide clarity of purpose and regular feedback (which is different than regular direction). While career development is ultimately the responsibility of each individual (who else?), time spent as a manager to proactively understand and enable growth is time-well spent. Sometimes people talk shit. Sometimes people have bad days. Don\u2019t take either personally. A personal mantra I\u2019ve found useful is \u201cwe were lucky but now is the time to be good.\u201d That is to say, let us pretend that all past success was the result of our situation and not our own hard work or good qualities. We now have a unique opportunity to reduce our dependence on luck through superior performance. There is no cost to this belief except your ego, and it can help drive radical self and team improvement.","title":"21 people management tips"},{"location":"management/people/21-management-tips/#21-management-things-i-learned-at-imgur-by-sam-gerstenzang-medium","text":"","title":"21 management things I learned at Imgur | by Sam Gerstenzang | Medium"},{"location":"management/people/21-management-tips/#excerpt","text":"It\u2019s terribly difficult to manage unmotivated people.

That being said, there's a number of excellent books, listed below. Turn the Ship Around!: A True Story of Turning Followers into Leaders # \ud83d\udcd6 Turn the Ship Around!: A True Story of Turning Followers into Leaders is hands down my preferred management book. This book made me truly understand what empowering local decision means. In particular, I liked how the author explains that the usual chain of command requires information to go up the chain, and decision to go down, which is insanely inefficient. It provides great tools for managers to help their team members come up with their own decisions, in particular the notion of deliberate action . There's a also a presentation that talks about the main concepts the author developed. There are numerous cheesy management books and this is not one of them. The narration is great as well and the explanations are short, and to the point. You can find a short summary in video here \u201cControl without competence is chaos.\u201d \u2014 L. David Marquet, Turn the Ship Around! Other generalist books # \ud83d\udcd6 The Advantage, Enhanced Edition: Why Organizational Health Trumps Everything Else In Business , Patrick M. Lencioni. The only way for people to embrace a message is to hear it over a period of time, in a variety of different situations, and preferably from different people. That\u2019s why great leaders see themselves as Chief Reminding Officers as much as anything else. The best way to do cascading communication is face-to-face and live. Seeing a leader and hearing the tone of his or her voice is critical for employees, as is being able to ask a question or two. But then again, most organizations are unhealthy precisely because they aren\u2019t doing the basic things, which require discipline, persistence, and follow-through more than sophistication or intelligence. \ud83d\udcd6 Managing Humans: Biting and Humorous Tales of a Software Engineering Manager : \"Read hilarious stories with serious lessons that Michael Lopp extracts from his varied and sometimes bizarre experiences as a manager at Apple, Pinterest, Palantir, Netscape, Symantec, Slack, and Borland. Many of the stories first appeared in primitive form in Lopp\u2019s perennially popular blog, Rands in Repose.\" \ud83d\udcd6 Oren Ellenbogen, Leading Snowflakes: the Engineering Manager Handbook : some truly great content and concrete ideas to move from maker to manager mode, code reviewing your management decisions, delegating tasks without losing quality or visibility. \ud83d\udcd6 Adam Grant, Give and Take: Why Helping Others Drives Our Success : \"This gem is a joy to read, and it shatters the myth that greed is the path to success.\", Robert Sutton. \ud83d\udcd6 Ken Blanchard, Lead Like Jesus: Lessons from the Greatest Leadership Role Model of All Time . \ud83d\udcd6 Andrew S. Grove, High Output Management . A landmark book by Intel CEO Andy Grove. Introduced many of the management best practices such as 1-1, OKR. Managerial leverage measures the impact of what managers do to increase the output of their teams. You need to plan the way a fire department plans. It cannot anticipate where the next fire will be, so it has to shape an energetic and efficient team that is capable of responding to the unanticipated as well as to any ordinary event. Every hour of your day should be spent increasing the output or the value of the output of the people whom you\u2019re responsible for. A common rule we should always try to heed is to detect and fix any problem in a production process at the lowest-value stage possible. A genuinely effective indicator will cover the output of the work unit and not simply the activity involved. Obviously, you measure a salesman by the orders he gets (output), not by the calls he makes (activity). A manager\u2019s output = The output of his organization + The output of the neighboring organizations under his influence. League standings are kept by team, not by individual. Business\u2014and this means not just the business of commerce but the business of education, the business of government, the business of medicine\u2014is a team activity. And, always, it takes a team to win. Your decision-making depends finally on how well you comprehend the facts and issues facing your business. This is why information-gathering is so important in a manager\u2019s life. The lack of a decision is the same as a negative decision; no green light is a red light, and work can stop for a whole organization. Delegation without follow-through is abdication. Any decision be worked out and reached at the lowest competent level. The reason is that this is where it will be made by people who are closest to the situation and know the most about it. Self-confidence mostly comes from a gut-level realization that nobody has ever died from making a wrong business decision, or taking inappropriate action, or being overruled. A successful MBO [management by objective] system needs only to answer two questions: 1. Where do I want to go? (The answer provides the objective.) 2. How will I pace myself to see if I am getting there? (The answer gives us milestones, or key results). The one thing an MBO system should provide par excellence is focus. This can only happen if we keep the number of objectives small. In practice, this is rare, and here, as elsewhere, we fall victim to our inability to say \u201cno\u201d\u2014in this case, to too many objectives. We must realize\u2014and act on the realization\u2014that if we try to focus on everything, we focus on nothing. A few extremely well-chosen objectives impart a clear message about what we say \u201cyes\u201d to and what we say \u201cno\u201d to\u2014which is what we must have if an MBO system is to work. Alfred Sloan summed up decades of experience at General Motors by saying, \u201cGood management rests on a reconciliation of centralization and decentralization.\u201d Or, we might say, on a balancing act to get the best combination of responsiveness and leverage. I would like to propose Grove\u2019s Law: All large organizations with a common business purpose end up in a hybrid organizational form. When a person is not doing his job, there can only be two reasons for it. The person either can\u2019t do it or won\u2019t do it; he is either not capable or not motivated. That variable is the task-relevant maturity (TRM) of the subordinates, which is a combination of the degree of their achievement orientation and readiness to take responsibility, as well as their education, training, and experience. When the TRM is low, the most effective approach is one that offers very precise and detailed instructions, wherein the supervisor tells the subordinate what needs to be done, when, and how: in other words, a highly structured approach. As the TRM of the subordinate grows, the most effective style moves from the structured to one more given to communication, emotional support, and encouragement. The responsibility for teaching the subordinate must be assumed by his supervisor, and not paid for by the customers of his organization, internal or external. At all times you should force yourself to assess performance, not potential. A manager generally has two ways to raise the level of individual performance of his subordinates: by increasing motivation, the desire of each person to do his job well, and by increasing individual capability, which is where training comes in. \ud83d\udcd6 Patrick Lencioni, The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A Leadership Fable . \ud83d\udcd6 Work Rules!: Insights from Inside Google That Will Transform How You Live and Lead, Laszlo Bock.

A solution-oriented book. Train your interview team to apply a limited-consensus approach to hiring. When groups use limited consensus, not everyone may agree with the decision, but each person should be satisfied enough with a particular candidate\u2019s suitability not to block the decision to hire him or her. What if the vetoer is someone I don\u2019t want to keep in the organization?\u201d The answer to this is simple: In the interview process, only involve employees whose work you respect and value. If an employee isn\u2019t successful in his or her technical position, don\u2019t make that employee part of the interview team. Make sure members of your team interview an internal candidate the same way they would interview an external candidate. Know why you\u2019re hiring more people. Define your problems to define your hiring strategy. Sometimes, the main reason a hiring manager doesn\u2019t hire a candidate is that he or she has a gut feeling that the person just won\u2019t fit well with the culture. But a \u201cgut feeling\u201d is not a good reason not to hire someone, so train yourself to articulate culture-fit differences. I personally do not consider certification to mean anything much when I am hiring someone for a technical position. Because the knowledge tested is functional-skills book knowledge, make sure you understand what the person must do to maintain his or her certification and the value of that certification to your environment. Too often, internal recruiters look for tool and technology expertise or for advanced academic degrees, rather than for functional skill or for product-domain experience. If you feel the need to take notes, take them on paper, never on a computer. My reason for this is that when you use a computer, you have to sit behind a screen, which creates a barrier between you and the candidate. Promising an unconditional promotion is not just risky; it is stupid. Circumstances within the company can change; the employee may not perform up to expectations; the economy may tank.

Your first responsibility as a manager is to manage yourself: your integrity, character, ethics, knowledge, wisdom, temperament, words and acts. The second responsibility is to manage those who have authority over us. The third responsibility is to manage your peers: without their respect and confidence, nothing can be accomplished. The fourth responsibility is to manage those whom we have authority. You can't manage your bosses, peers, regulators etc. But you can understand them, motivate them, influence them, forgive them. \"It is from failure that amazing growth and grace so often come, provided only that one can recognise it, admit it, learn from it, rise above it, and try again. True leadership presumes a standard quite beyond human perfectibility and that is quite alright, for joy and satisfaction are in the pursuit of an objective, not in its realization.\" Quote: \"If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people to collect wood and don't assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea.\", Antoine de Saint-Exupery \"Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things.\", Peter Drucker Meetings # On Better Meetings : Lara Hogan shares tips about ensuring efficient meetings. \ud83c\udf9e Almost Live! - Middle Management Suck-Ups : a great example of a terrible ineffective meeting.

Good managers address context first, then content. Good managers know that, above all else, they are agents of their company. Their default mode is to make and facilitate company-optimal choices. Good managers know that fixing broader company culture is an important part of their role as a designated leader within the company. Good managers understand that the long game is all about people.

Onboarding new team members # \ud83c\udf9e 5 Onboarding Fiascos From the Movies Organization structure # Martin Casado, Hire a VP of Engineering on the Andreessen Horowitz blog The most important function of a VP of engineering is to build out the engineering team and set a startup\u2019s engineering culture. Competent engineering management should therefore be able to push the team towards more practical, incremental designs that can garner useful external feedback quickly \u2014 without compromising the long-term generality of the system. The VP\u2019s role here is not producing the architecture, but ensuring that incremental release is a real requirement in the design process. Strong engineering management tends to give their teams enough ownership and latitude that they are happy and fulfilled in driving the product forward. AVC, VP Engineering Vs CTO Mark Suster, Want to Know the Difference Between a CTO and a VP Engineering? \ud83c\udfa4 CTO vs VP Engineering Balancing Innovation , Bryan Cantrill, Jason Hoffman Spotify\u2019s Failed #SquadGoals Engineering managers in this model had little responsibility beyond the career development of the people they managed. There was no single person accountable for the engineering team\u2019s delivery or who could negotiate prioritization of work at an equivalent level of responsibility. Autonomy requires alignment. Company priorities must be defined by leadership. Autonomy does not mean teams get to do whatever they want. Business units, departments, teams, and managers more effectively communicate organization structure roles and responsibilities than Spotify\u2019s synonyms and are not attached to a way of working that failed their creator. Independence,autonomy,too many small teams Every autonomous team is expected to generate direct business value all by itself, without a lot of overlap with other teams. The team should be able to meets its goals independently (i.e. without reliance on or interference from other teams). Coordination, also known as alignment, communication, shared roadmap, Gantt chart and many other positive sounding names, is the arch-enemy of the autonomous team. Production and productivity # The Toyota Way , Wikipedia Base your management decisions on a long-term philosophy, even at the expense of short-term financial goals. Create a continuous process flow to bring problems to the surface. Use \"pull\" systems to avoid overproduction. Level out the workload Build a culture of stopping to fix problems, to get quality right the first time Standardized tasks and processes are the foundation for continuous improvement and employee empowerment. Use visual control so no problems are hidden. Use only reliable, thoroughly tested technology that serves your people and processes. Grow leaders who thoroughly understand the work, live the philosophy, and teach it to others. Develop exceptional people and teams who follow your company's philosophy. Respect your extended network of partners and suppliers by challenging them and helping them improve.

Now I do not think software managers have less inherent courage and firmness than chefs, nor than other engineering managers. But false scheduling to match the patron's desired date is much more common in our discipline than elsewhere in engineering. The boss must first distinguish between action information and status information. He must discipline himself not to act on problems his managers can solve.

Building software is a team effort. Globalize your code languages. Team cohesion is what matters the most.

Can Do Vs Must Do , AVC. \"Doing a startup is like playing a video game. Each level requires you to master one thing and once you do that, you level up and then there is a new thing to master.\" \"Waterline principle\" from Bill Gore: \"Think of being on a ship, and imagine that any decision gone bad will blow a hole in the side of the ship. If you blow a hole above the waterline (where the ship won\u2019t take on water and possibly sink), you can patch the hole, learn from the experience, and sail on. But if you blow a hole below the waterline, you can find yourself facing gushers of water pouring in, pulling you toward the ocean floor. And if it\u2019s a big enough hole, you might go down really fast, just like some of the financial firm catastrophes of 2008. To be clear, great enterprises do make big bets, but they avoid big bets that could blow holes below the waterline.\", How We Might Fall.

This book made me truly understand what empowering local decision means. In particular, I liked how the author explains that the usual chain of command requires information to go up the chain, and decision to go down, which is insanely inefficient. It provides great tools for managers to help their team members come up with their own decisions, in particular the notion of deliberate action . There's a also a presentation that talks about the main concepts the author developed. There are numerous cheesy management books and this is not one of them.

Lencioni. The only way for people to embrace a message is to hear it over a period of time, in a variety of different situations, and preferably from different people. That\u2019s why great leaders see themselves as Chief Reminding Officers as much as anything else. The best way to do cascading communication is face-to-face and live. Seeing a leader and hearing the tone of his or her voice is critical for employees, as is being able to ask a question or two. But then again, most organizations are unhealthy precisely because they aren\u2019t doing the basic things, which require discipline, persistence, and follow-through more than sophistication or intelligence. \ud83d\udcd6 Managing Humans: Biting and Humorous Tales of a Software Engineering Manager : \"Read hilarious stories with serious lessons that Michael Lopp extracts from his varied and sometimes bizarre experiences as a manager at Apple, Pinterest, Palantir, Netscape, Symantec, Slack, and Borland.

Grove, High Output Management . A landmark book by Intel CEO Andy Grove. Introduced many of the management best practices such as 1-1, OKR. Managerial leverage measures the impact of what managers do to increase the output of their teams. You need to plan the way a fire department plans. It cannot anticipate where the next fire will be, so it has to shape an energetic and efficient team that is capable of responding to the unanticipated as well as to any ordinary event. Every hour of your day should be spent increasing the output or the value of the output of the people whom you\u2019re responsible for. A common rule we should always try to heed is to detect and fix any problem in a production process at the lowest-value stage possible. A genuinely effective indicator will cover the output of the work unit and not simply the activity involved. Obviously, you measure a salesman by the orders he gets (output), not by the calls he makes (activity). A manager\u2019s output = The output of his organization + The output of the neighboring organizations under his influence. League standings are kept by team, not by individual. Business\u2014and this means not just the business of commerce but the business of education, the business of government, the business of medicine\u2014is a team activity. And, always, it takes a team to win. Your decision-making depends finally on how well you comprehend the facts and issues facing your business. This is why information-gathering is so important in a manager\u2019s life. The lack of a decision is the same as a negative decision; no green light is a red light, and work can stop for a whole organization. Delegation without follow-through is abdication. Any decision be worked out and reached at the lowest competent level. The reason is that this is where it will be made by people who are closest to the situation and know the most about it. Self-confidence mostly comes from a gut-level realization that nobody has ever died from making a wrong business decision, or taking inappropriate action, or being overruled. A successful MBO [management by objective] system needs only to answer two questions: 1. Where do I want to go? (The answer provides the objective.) 2. How will I pace myself to see if I am getting there? (The answer gives us milestones, or key results). The one thing an MBO system should provide par excellence is focus. This can only happen if we keep the number of objectives small. In practice, this is rare, and here, as elsewhere, we fall victim to our inability to say \u201cno\u201d\u2014in this case, to too many objectives. We must realize\u2014and act on the realization\u2014that if we try to focus on everything, we focus on nothing. A few extremely well-chosen objectives impart a clear message about what we say \u201cyes\u201d to and what we say \u201cno\u201d to\u2014which is what we must have if an MBO system is to work. Alfred Sloan summed up decades of experience at General Motors by saying, \u201cGood management rests on a reconciliation of centralization and decentralization.\u201d Or, we might say, on a balancing act to get the best combination of responsiveness and leverage. I would like to propose Grove\u2019s Law: All large organizations with a common business purpose end up in a hybrid organizational form. When a person is not doing his job, there can only be two reasons for it. The person either can\u2019t do it or won\u2019t do it; he is either not capable or not motivated. That variable is the task-relevant maturity (TRM) of the subordinates, which is a combination of the degree of their achievement orientation and readiness to take responsibility, as well as their education, training, and experience. When the TRM is low, the most effective approach is one that offers very precise and detailed instructions, wherein the supervisor tells the subordinate what needs to be done, when, and how: in other words, a highly structured approach. As the TRM of the subordinate grows, the most effective style moves from the structured to one more given to communication, emotional support, and encouragement. The responsibility for teaching the subordinate must be assumed by his supervisor, and not paid for by the customers of his organization, internal or external. At all times you should force yourself to assess performance, not potential. A manager generally has two ways to raise the level of individual performance of his subordinates: by increasing motivation, the desire of each person to do his job well, and by increasing individual capability, which is where training comes in. \ud83d\udcd6 Patrick Lencioni, The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A Leadership Fable . \ud83d\udcd6 Work Rules!: Insights from Inside Google That Will Transform How You Live and Lead, Laszlo Bock.

A solution-oriented book. Train your interview team to apply a limited-consensus approach to hiring. When groups use limited consensus, not everyone may agree with the decision, but each person should be satisfied enough with a particular candidate\u2019s suitability not to block the decision to hire him or her. What if the vetoer is someone I don\u2019t want to keep in the organization?\u201d The answer to this is simple: In the interview process, only involve employees whose work you respect and value. If an employee isn\u2019t successful in his or her technical position, don\u2019t make that employee part of the interview team. Make sure members of your team interview an internal candidate the same way they would interview an external candidate. Know why you\u2019re hiring more people. Define your problems to define your hiring strategy. Sometimes, the main reason a hiring manager doesn\u2019t hire a candidate is that he or she has a gut feeling that the person just won\u2019t fit well with the culture. But a \u201cgut feeling\u201d is not a good reason not to hire someone, so train yourself to articulate culture-fit differences. I personally do not consider certification to mean anything much when I am hiring someone for a technical position. Because the knowledge tested is functional-skills book knowledge, make sure you understand what the person must do to maintain his or her certification and the value of that certification to your environment. Too often, internal recruiters look for tool and technology expertise or for advanced academic degrees, rather than for functional skill or for product-domain experience. If you feel the need to take notes, take them on paper, never on a computer. My reason for this is that when you use a computer, you have to sit behind a screen, which creates a barrier between you and the candidate. Promising an unconditional promotion is not just risky; it is stupid. Circumstances within the company can change; the employee may not perform up to expectations; the economy may tank.

Wartime CEO violates protocol in order to win. Excerpts from One From Many, Dee Hock , Zack Kanter on Twitter. Your first responsibility as a manager is to manage yourself: your integrity, character, ethics, knowledge, wisdom, temperament, words and acts. The second responsibility is to manage those who have authority over us. The third responsibility is to manage your peers: without their respect and confidence, nothing can be accomplished. The fourth responsibility is to manage those whom we have authority. You can't manage your bosses, peers, regulators etc. But you can understand them, motivate them, influence them, forgive them. \"It is from failure that amazing growth and grace so often come, provided only that one can recognise it, admit it, learn from it, rise above it, and try again. True leadership presumes a standard quite beyond human perfectibility and that is quite alright, for joy and satisfaction are in the pursuit of an objective, not in its realization.\" Quote: \"If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people to collect wood and don't assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea.\", Antoine de Saint-Exupery \"Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things.\", Peter Drucker","title":"Management style"},{"location":"management/people/engineering-management/#meetings","text":"On Better Meetings : Lara Hogan shares tips about ensuring efficient meetings. \ud83c\udf9e Almost Live! - Middle Management Suck-Ups : a great example of a terrible ineffective meeting.
