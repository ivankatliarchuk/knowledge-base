Make your job easier and don\u2019t.</li> <li> Different people need different kinds of management. Be adaptable to figure out what drives each person\u2019s best performance.</li> <li> Give feedback frequently and directly. As a manager, it\u2019s easier to wait and then hedge critical feedback in soft wrappers, but that\u2019s selfish. I\u2019d try to give feedback as soon as I could grab a conference room with the person, and not wait until the formal 1:1 days later.</li> <li> A-players love hearing critical feedback about how they\u2019re performing, and they hate when B-players don\u2019t hear feedback of their own. Keep your A-players happy by providing actionable feedback to everyone and recognizing superior performance.</li> <li> Communication is the most difficult thing you\u2019ll do. Spend a lot of time on it, both on your own communication and improving the communication of the folks on your team.</li> <li> Fire quickly. If you don\u2019t fire bad performers fast, you\u2019re at risk of losing your good performers. Don\u2019t underestimate the effect bad performers have on good performers. Your team will likely move faster even with fewer bodies. Finally, firing for bad performance is easier than having to fire good people because you\u2019ve run out of money, so fire the bad people before you have to fire the good people too.</li> <li> People need to feel like they\u2019ve been listened to, not to make the final call. Take the time to listen (you might be wrong), make a decision and then explain the decision. Don\u2019t offer commentary on others\u2019 decisions until you understand why the decisions were made.</li> <li> Providing context for why you made a decision is a way to scale your decision-making process. The goal is for the manager to make as few decisions as possible, and to do this, your team needs to understand how to make good decisions.</li> <li> Define success clearly and don\u2019t flip-flop on the definition without new information. On the other hand, when the facts change, re-evaluate your goals. Set achievable but difficult targets.</li> <li> Hiring friends can be very useful because communication will be easier, and your friends are probably smart and talented. But you might do so at the cost of hiring for things like experience or domain-expertise. If you can\u2019t fire friends, don\u2019t hire them.</li> <li> Mission-oriented teams are a competitive advantage because they make it easier to 1) hire and 2) motivate.</li> <li> Any action taken between a manager and an individual (a promotion, more frequent 1:1's, a call out in a meeting) is not just between the manager and the individual, but affects every person on the team. For example, if you promote one person, make sure the rest of the team understands why that person was promoted and what needs to be done to achieve the same.</li> <li> You\u2019re more likely to lose by not recognizing your weaknesses than from the presence of weakness, so aim for self-awareness.</li> <li> Sometimes you\u2019ll have to bet on big, resource intensive projects that won\u2019t work. Be careful of the morale toll on your team. Not everyone has great tolerance for repeated failure. If you\u2019re a founder, you probably are more used to this than your team. One technique is to mix iterative work with riskier bigger bets to rebuild this energy. But you should also try to not paint any feature as a silver bullet, and individual failure in good faith as a necessary cost of trying new things. Your company is a portfolio bet.</li> <li> How you spend money is one of the biggest cultural signals you can send and is very hard to change. Where you spend money (and where you don\u2019t) communicates what you think is important.</li> <li> The best way to avoid politics isn\u2019t to ignore politics, but to spend your time on it. Define clear merit-based systems, which reduces confusion about what your team members need to do be recognized.</li> <li> One of the most helpful things you can do is remind the team of the bigger picture. Knowing what\u2019s important will help cut through the bullshit.</li> <li> The best way to manage great people is to provide clarity of purpose and regular feedback (which is different than regular direction).</li> <li> While career development is ultimately the responsibility of each individual (who else?), time spent as a manager to proactively understand and enable growth is time-well spent.</li> <li> Sometimes people talk shit. Sometimes people have bad days. Don\u2019t take either personally.</li> <li> A personal mantra I\u2019ve found useful is \u201cwe were lucky but now is the time to be good.\u201d That is to say, let us pretend that all past success was the result of our situation and not our own hard work or good qualities. We now have a unique opportunity to reduce our dependence on luck through superior performance. There is no cost to this belief except your ego, and it can help drive radical self and team improvement.</li> </ul>","tags":["people management","tips","career"]},{"location":"leadership/career/21-management-tips/#excerpt","title":"Excerpt","text":"<p>It\u2019s terribly difficult to manage unmotivated people.

Grove, High Output Management. A landmark book by Intel CEO Andy Grove.

It cannot anticipate where the next fire will be, so it has to shape an energetic and efficient team that is capable of responding to the unanticipated as well as to any ordinary event.</li> <li>Every hour of your day should be spent increasing the output or the value of the output of the people whom you\u2019re responsible for.</li> <li>A common rule we should always try to heed is to detect and fix any problem in a production process at the lowest-value stage possible.</li> <li>A genuinely effective indicator will cover the output of the work unit and not simply the activity involved. Obviously, you measure a salesman by the orders he gets (output), not by the calls he makes (activity).</li> <li>A manager\u2019s output = The output of his organization + The output of the neighboring organizations under his influence.</li> <li>League standings are kept by team, not by individual. Business\u2014and this means not just the business of commerce but the business of education, the business of government, the business of medicine\u2014is a team activity. And, always, it takes a team to win.</li> <li>Your decision-making depends finally on how well you comprehend the facts and issues facing your business. This is why information-gathering is so important in a manager\u2019s life.</li> <li>The lack of a decision is the same as a negative decision; no green light is a red light, and work can stop for a whole organization.</li> <li>Delegation without follow-through is abdication.</li> <li>Any decision be worked out and reached at the lowest competent level. The reason is that this is where it will be made by people who are closest to the situation and know the most about it.</li> <li>Self-confidence mostly comes from a gut-level realization that nobody has ever died from making a wrong business decision, or taking inappropriate action, or being overruled.</li> <li>A successful MBO [management by objective] system needs only to answer two questions: 1.\u00a0\u00a0Where do I want to go? (The answer provides the objective.) 2.\u00a0\u00a0How will I pace myself to see if I am getting there? (The answer gives us milestones, or key results).</li> <li>The one thing an MBO system should provide par excellence is focus. This can only happen if we keep the number of objectives small. In practice, this is rare, and here, as elsewhere, we fall victim to our inability to say \u201cno\u201d\u2014in this case, to too many objectives. We must realize\u2014and act on the realization\u2014that if we try to focus on everything, we focus on nothing. A few extremely well-chosen objectives impart a clear message about what we say \u201cyes\u201d to and what we say \u201cno\u201d to\u2014which is what we must have if an MBO system is to work.</li> <li>Alfred Sloan summed up decades of experience at General Motors by saying, \u201cGood management rests on a reconciliation of centralization and decentralization.\u201d Or, we might say, on a balancing act to get the best combination of responsiveness and leverage.</li> <li>I would like to propose Grove\u2019s Law: All large organizations with a common business purpose end up in a hybrid organizational form.</li> <li>When a person is not doing his job, there can only be two reasons for it. The person either can\u2019t do it or won\u2019t do it; he is either not capable or not motivated.</li> <li>That variable is the task-relevant maturity (TRM) of the subordinates, which is a combination of the degree of their achievement orientation and readiness to take responsibility, as well as their education, training, and experience.</li> <li>When the TRM is low, the most effective approach is one that offers very precise and detailed instructions, wherein the supervisor tells the subordinate what needs to be done, when, and how: in other words, a highly structured approach. As the TRM of the subordinate grows, the most effective style moves from the structured to one more given to communication, emotional support, and encouragement.</li> <li>The responsibility for teaching the subordinate must be assumed by his supervisor, and not paid for by the customers of his organization, internal or external.</li> <li>At all times you should force yourself to assess performance, not potential.</li> <li>A manager generally has two ways to raise the level of individual performance of his subordinates: by increasing motivation, the desire of each person to do his job well, and by increasing individual capability, which is where training comes in.</li> </ul> </li> <li>\ud83d\udcd6 Patrick Lencioni, The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A Leadership Fable.</li> <li>\ud83d\udcd6 Work Rules!: Insights from Inside Google That Will Transform How You Live and Lead, Laszlo Bock.

It must be a string with a minimum length of 1 character and a maximum length of 63 characters. The key cannot be empty. You can use a standard set of label keys that work best for your organization that cover business use cases like <code>environment</code>, <code>data-classification</code>, <code>cost-center</code>, <code>team</code>, <code>component</code>, <code>application</code> and <code>compliance</code>. Label value The label value is the data associated with the key. It can be a string, number, or Boolean value. As a best practice, consider defining a set of values for each label key. This can help teams select and assign appropriate values for each key. For example, an <code>environment</code> key can have values such as <code>prod</code>, <code>staging</code>, <code>dev</code> or <code>tools</code>. Stakeholder Identify the department which needs the label key for filtering resources or creating reports. For example, a Finance department in an organization would like to know the cost of running the <code>prod</code> environment. They would use the label key:value pair <code>environment:prod</code>. Target resource For each label, consider defining a target Google Cloud resource where the label key:value pair should be applied. For example, the label key <code>environment</code> needs to be on each Google Cloud resource in your organization's production environment. Exception Consider defining which label keys are mandatory on all resources and which keys are optional to apply. In the example table, there are some label <code>key:value</code> pairs that are optional such as <code>environment:tools</code>.

This can be the GCP region name, a logical region you have setup in your application, or having a label for each.</li> <li>_Resource Creator     _Putting the name of the creator in a label will help sort out who created what resource later instead of having to dig through audit logs that may or may not have been retained.</li> <li>_Owner or maintainer     _Labeling a resource with the owner or maintainer\u2019s name assists in who to contact in the case of an issue or question later. A common example of this would be the team that owns or maintains the resource.</li> <li>_Cost, billing, or budget code     _Some organizations have codes for different expenditures or budgets. Adding these into the label makes it easier for billing administrators or auditors to track these.</li> <li>Department     If the resource belongs to a certain department then adding it as a label makes it easier to track down a department later.</li> <li>_Bucket name (Google Cloud Storage only)     _If you have ever had to look at a GCP billing report or invoice you realize it groups all of the storage buckets together into one line item. This is a nightmare if you want to know what each bucket costs, so adding the bucket name as a label to each bucket will allow this to be broken out into separate line items.</li> <li>_Associated resource name     _If you have a resource that\u2019s tied to another resource it\u2019s a good idea to add a label naming that resource to it. Examples of this might be a persistent disk tied to a Compute Engine instance or a Dataproc cluster. An external IP that is tied to a Compute Engine managed instance group is a great example of this as well.</li> <li>_Data classification     _This is a broad labeling use case, but if you have any sort of data that needs to be labeled in a bucket or BigQuery dataset then add a label for it to denote this. Examples might be data that falls under regulatory compliance such as HIPAA or PCI or encrypted data. It\u2019s best to label these resources with this so when a C-level executive asks how much money is spent on storing PHI (protected health information) per month it can be pulled up very quickly.</li> <li>Resource state     If a resource is active, pending deletion, disabled, etc. then labeling it as so makes it very easy to see how much is being billed to resources in a particular state.</li> <li>_Folder or organization name     _If you utilize folders or different organizational units in your organizational structure make a label them to be able to see what each organization or folder costs you later.</li> </ol>","tags":["devops","sre","platform"]},{"location":"sre-platform-devops/architecture-bp/","title":"arcthitecture & best practices","text":"<p>Arcthitecture &amp; Best Practices</p> <p>This is a collection of architecture and security stuff, research and best practices.</p>","tags":["architecture","best practices"]},{"location":"sre-platform-devops/architecture-bp/#best-practices","title":"Best Practices","text":"","tags":["architecture","best practices"]},{"location":"sre-platform-devops/architecture-bp/#best-practices-kubernetes","title":"Best Practices: Kubernetes","text":"K8s Resource limits <p>K8s Resource limits Kubernetes best practices: Resource requests and limits</p>","tags":["architecture","best practices"]},{"location":"sre-platform-devops/architecture-bp/#best-practices-system-platform-and-api-security","title":"Best Practices: System, Platform and API Security","text":"<ul> <li>Auth Zero</li> <li>7 API Sec Best Practices</li> <li>Dot CMS</li> <li>Helm: best practices</li> </ul>","tags":["architecture","best practices"]},{"location":"sre-platform-devops/awesome/","title":"awesome pages","text":"<p>awesome</p> <p>Awesome lists about all kinds of interesting topics</p> <ul> <li>Mixed: different awesome areas</li> <li>Github profiles: a curated list of awesome Github Profile READMEs</li> <li>Keyboards: a collection of ergonomic split keyboards</li> <li>Open University: collection of awesome Open University projects by students and for students</li> </ul>","tags":["eduction","awesome pages","production","awesome","security","cyber-sec"]},{"location":"sre-platform-devops/awesome/#automation-devops-architecture","title":"Automation &amp; DevOps &amp; Architecture","text":"<ul> <li>Sysadmin: awesome open source sysadmin resources</li> <li>Status Pages: list of status page open source software</li> <li>Terraform: curated list of resources on HashiCorp's Terraform</li> <li>AWS ecs: a curated list of awesome ECS guides, development tools, and resources</li> <li>Sysadmin: awesome open source sysadmin resources</li> <li>Automation pipelines: a curated list of awesome pipeline toolkits inspired by Awesome Sysadmin</li> <li>Pythons: a curated list of awesome Python frameworks, libraries, software and resources</li> <li>Network Automation: awesome list about Network Automation</li> <li>Github Actions: a curated list of awesome actions to use on GitHub</li> <li>Static Analysis: static analysis tools for all programming languages</li> <li>Scalability: the Patterns of Scalable, Reliable, and Performant Large-Scale Systems</li> <li>Monorepo: curated list of awesome Monorepo tools, software and architectures.</li> <li>Monorepo: tools</li> </ul>","tags":["eduction","awesome pages","production","awesome","security","cyber-sec"]},{"location":"sre-platform-devops/awesome/#devops-sre","title":"DevOps &amp; SRE","text":"<ul> <li>Awesome SRE</li> </ul>","tags":["eduction","awesome pages","production","awesome","security","cyber-sec"]},{"location":"sre-platform-devops/awesome/#clouds","title":"Clouds","text":"<ul> <li>AWS: a curated list of awesome Amazon Web Services (AWS)</li> <li>Google Cloud: a curated list of awesome stuff for Google Cloud Platform.

The Developer Program Policies are designed to ensure that the Play store remains a trusted resource for Android users. Review the policies thoroughly as there are consequences for violations.</li> <li>Prepare your developer account. Sign up for a developer account and check your developer account details are accurate. If you're going to sell products, set up your merchant account.</li> <li>Plan for localization. If you plan on including localized copies of your app at launch, start planning early and follow the Localization checklist.</li> <li>Plan for simultaneous releases. Releasing your app on multiple platforms and devices maximizes your promotion activities and the number of installs, so include it in your development plans upfront. If you can't launch your app on all platforms at once, ask for users' contact details and let them know when your app is ready.</li> <li>Test against the quality guidelines. Quality guidelines for all apps plus specific criteria for tablet, TV, and Auto apps provide testing templates. You use these to confirm that your apps offer the basic UI design, features, and functions expected by Android users.</li> <li>Target a recent API level. Google Play requires that new apps target at least Android 9.0 (API level 28), and that app updates target at least Android 9.0 starting on November 1, 2019.</li> <li>Build your Android App Bundle. When you're ready to make your app available to users, either for testing or as a final product, build your Android App Bundle in Android Studio. Google Play will use your app bundle to generate, sign and serve optimized APKs for each user's device, resulting in a smaller app to download and install.</li> <li>Run internal tests. Use the internal test track to push your app to up to 100 internal testers to get feedback before making your app available to external users in the closed, open, or production tracks. Use multiple closed test tracks for different versions of your app before pushing them to open test tracks or production.</li> <li>Plan your app's Play store listing. Prepare the descriptions, promotional graphics, screenshots, and videos you'll add to your app's Play store page. Make sure you include a link to your privacy policy if required. Localize your store listing in all the languages your app supports and for the countries you're targeting.</li> <li>Build interest in your app or game with pre-registration and set up a custom pre-registration listing page.</li> <li>Upload your Android App Bundle to the closed or an open test track. Closed and open testing tracks can help greatly in discovering issues with your app, giving you the opportunity to fix those issues and raise the quality of your initial release. Learn how to upload an Android App Bundle and learn about best practices for open tests.</li> <li>Define your app's device compatibility. Let the Play store know which Android versions and device screen sizes your app is designed to work on.</li> <li>Check the pre-launch reports. When you upload an Android App Bundle to the closed or open track, you'll receive a pre-launch report. With this report you can identify the issues found after your app is tested automatically on a wide-range of real devices running different versions of Android.</li> <li>Setup your app's price and countries of distribution. Once you've determined your monetization model, setup your app as free or paid and select the countries in which it will be distributed.</li> <li>Opt- in to the right distribution options. From the pricing &amp; distribution page, opt-in to specific devices and programs, such as Wear OS by Google, Android TV, and Designed for families. Google Play can then review your app and, once approved, make it more discoverable for users.</li> <li>Set up your in-app products and subscriptions. Confirm the countries you can sell into and currency and tax issues to consider. Then set up your merchant account and add details and prices for your in-app products and subscriptions.</li> <li>Determine your app's content rating. Providing an appropriate rating for your app is a requirement of the Developer Program Policies but, it also ensures your app gets seen by the right age-based audiences.</li> <li>Final checks and publishing. First, go back and double check you've done everything on this list. Now you're ready to publish your app to the production channel. If you're releasing an app update, use staged rollouts to release your update to progressively more users. This allows you to halt the update if you find an issue, so you can limit the number of users it affects.</li> <li>Promote your app. Start promoting your app with the Google Play badge. Check out our other marketing tools and growth best practices to start growing your audience.</li> <li>Browse and reply to user reviews. Understand what users think of your app and reply to their reviews to address any issues you might not have spotted in testing.</li> <li>Check your vitals. Android vitals shows you important information based your app running on real devices to help you understand and fix stability and performance issues. Improving your vitals will result in a better user experience, more engaged users, and higher ratings.</li> <li>Woohoo, you've launched! What next? First, take a break. Then check out our best practices on increasing engagement and retention in your app, growing your audience, and earning more revenue.</li> </ol>","tags":["checklist","android","app"]},{"location":"sre-platform-devops/check-lists/app-migration-process/","title":"application migration process","text":"","tags":["checklist","application migration","process"]},{"location":"sre-platform-devops/check-lists/app-migration-process/#application-migration-process","title":"Application Migration Process","text":"<p>Application migration is the process of moving a software application from one computing environment to another.

This post relates to protecting your virtual infrastructure within AWS.</p> <p>Protecting any computing infrastructure requires a layered or defense-in-depth approach. The layers are typically divided into physical, network (perimeter and internal), system (or host), application, and data. In an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) environment, AWS is responsible for security \u2018of\u2019 the cloud including the physical perimeter, hardware, compute, storage and networking, while customers are responsible for security \u2018in\u2019 the cloud, or on layers above the hypervisor. This includes the operating system, perimeter and internal network, application and data.</p> <p>Infrastructure protection requires defining trust boundaries (e.g., network boundaries and packet filtering), system security configuration and maintenance (e.g., hardening and patching), operating system authentication and authorizations (e.g., users, keys, and access levels), and other appropriate policy enforcement points (e.g., web application firewalls and/or API gateways).</p> <p>The key AWS service that supports service-level protection is AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) while Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is the fundamental service that contributes to securing infrastructure hosted on AWS.

In addition, there are several other services or features provided by AWS that can be leveraged for infrastructure protection.</p> <p>The following list mainly focuses on network and host-level boundary protection, protecting integrity of the operating system on EC2 instances and Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) and security of containers on AWS.</p> <p>The checklist provides best practice for the following:</p> <ol> <li>How are you enforcing network and host-level boundary protection?</li> <li>How are you protecting against distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks at network and application level?</li> <li>How are you managing the threat of malware?</li> <li>How are you identifying vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the operating system of your Amazon EC2 instances?</li> <li>How are you protecting the integrity of the operating system on your Amazon EC2 instances?</li> <li>How are you ensuring security of containers on AWS?</li> <li>How are you ensuring only trusted Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) are launched?</li> <li>How are you creating secure custom (private or public) AMIs?</li> </ol> <p>IMPORTANT NOTE: Identity and access management is an integral part of securing an infrastructure, however, you\u2019ll notice that the following checklist does not focus on the AWS IAM service.

as the preStop handler to customize what happened before a Pod is deleted.</p> <ul> <li> </li> </ul> <p>You can be notified when the Pod is about to be terminated by capturing the SIGTERM signal in your app.</p> <p>You should also pay attention to forwarding the signal to the right process in your container.</p> <ul> <li> </li> </ul> <p>If the calling app is not closing the TCP connection (e.g. using TCP keep-alive or a connection pool) it will connect to one Pod and not use the other Pods in that Service.</p> <p>But what happens when a Pod is deleted?</p> <p>Ideally, the request should go to another Pod.</p> <p>However, the calling app has a long-lived connection open with the Pod that is about to be terminated, and it will keep using it.</p> <p>On the other hand, you shouldn't abruptly terminate long-lived connections.</p> <p>Instead, you should terminate them before shutting down the app.</p> <p>You can read about keep-alive connections on this article about gracefully

applies to CPU limits.</p> <p>But should you always set limits and requests for memory and CPU?</p> <p>Yes and no.</p> <p>If your process goes over the memory limit, the process is terminated.</p> <p>Since CPU is a compressible resource, if your container goes over the limit, the process is throttled.</p> <p>Even if it could have used some of the CPU that was available at that moment.</p>

Similarly, when the utilisation of the existing worker nodes is low, the Cluster Autoscaler can scale down by evicting all the workloads from one of the worker nodes and removing it.</p> <p>Using the Cluster Autoscaler makes sense for highly variable workloads, for example, when the number of Pods may multiply in a short time, and then go back to the previous value. In such scenarios, the Cluster Autoscaler allows you to meet the demand spikes without wasting resources by overprovisioning worker nodes.</p> <p>However, if your workloads do not vary so much, it may not be worth to set up the Cluster Autoscaler, as it may never be triggered.

security risk to let your containers do this.</p> <p>Valid uses cases for privileged Pods include using hardware on the node such as GPUs.</p> <p>You can learn more about security contexts and privileges containers from this article.</p> <ul> <li> </li> </ul> <p>Running a read-only file system in your containers forces your containers to be immutable.</p> <p>Not only does this mitigate some old (and risky) practices such as hot patching, but also helps you prevent the risks of malicious processes storing or manipulating data inside a container.</p> <p>Running containers with a read-only file system might sound straightforward, but it might come with some complexity.</p> <p>What if you need to write logs or store files in a temporary folder?</p> <p>You can learn about the trade-offs in this article on running containers securely in production.</p> <ul> <li> </li> </ul> <p>A process running in a container is no different from any other process on the host, except it has a small piece of metadata that declares that it's in a container.</p> <p>Hence, root in a container is the same root (uid 0) as on the host machine.</p> <p>If a user manages to break out of an application running as root in a container, they may be able to gain access to the host with the same root user.</p> <p>Configuring containers to use unprivileged users, is the best way to prevent privilege escalation attacks.</p> <p>If you wish to learn more, the follow article offers some detailed explanation examples of what happens when you run your containers as root.</p> <ul> <li> </li> </ul> <p>Linux capabilities give processes the ability to do some of the many privileged operations only the root user can do by default.</p> <p>For example, <code>CAP_CHOWN</code> allows a process to \"make arbitrary changes to file UIDs and GIDs\".</p> <p>Even if your process doesn't run as <code>root</code>, there's a chance that a process could use those root-like features by escalating privileges.</p> <p>In other words, you should enable only the capabilities that you need if you don't want to be compromised.</p> <p>But what capabilities should be enabled and why?</p> <p>The following two articles dive into the theory and practical best-practices about capabilities in the Linux Kernel:</p> <ul> <li>Linux Capabilities: Why They Exist and How They Work</li> <li> <p>Linux Capabilities In Practice</p> </li> <li> </li> <li> <p>containers can talk to any other container in the network, and there's no translation of addresses in the process \u2014 i.e. no NAT is involved</p> </li> <li>nodes in the cluster can talk to any other container in the network and vice-versa. Even in this case, there's no translation of addresses \u2014 i.e. no NAT</li> <li>a container's IP address is always the same, independently if seen from another container or itself.</li> </ul> <p>The first rule isn't helping if you plan to segregate your cluster in smaller chunks and have isolation between namespaces.</p> <p>Imagine if a user in your cluster were able to use any other service in the cluster.</p> <p>Now, imagine if a malicious user in the cluster were to obtain access to the cluster \u2014 they could make requests to the whole cluster.</p> <p>To fix that, you can define how Pods should be allowed to communicate in the current namespace and cross-namespace using Network Policies.</p> <ul> <li> </li> <li> </li> </ul>","tags":["checklist","k8s","kubernetes","best practices","production"]},{"location":"sre-platform-devops/check-lists/k8s-best-pratices-checklist/#namespaces-have-limitrange","title":"Namespaces have LimitRange","text":"","tags":["checklist","k8s","kubernetes","best practices","production"]},{"location":"sre-platform-devops/check-lists/k8s-best-pratices-checklist/#namespaces-have-resourcequotas","title":"Namespaces have ResourceQuotas","text":"","tags":["checklist","k8s","kubernetes","best practices","production"]},{"location":"sre-platform-devops/check-lists/k8s-best-pratices-checklist/#enable-pod-security-policies","title":"Enable Pod Security Policies","text":"","tags":["checklist","k8s","kubernetes","best practices","production"]},{"location":"sre-platform-devops/check-lists/k8s-best-pratices-checklist/#disable-privileged-containers","title":"Disable privileged containers","text":"","tags":["checklist","k8s","kubernetes","best practices","production"]},{"location":"sre-platform-devops/check-lists/k8s-best-pratices-checklist/#use-a-read-only-filesystem-in-containers","title":"Use a read-only filesystem in containers","text":"","tags":["checklist","k8s","kubernetes","best practices","production"]},{"location":"sre-platform-devops/check-lists/k8s-best-pratices-checklist/#prevent-containers-from-running-as-root","title":"Prevent containers from running as root","text":"","tags":["checklist","k8s","kubernetes","best practices","production"]},{"location":"sre-platform-devops/check-lists/k8s-best-pratices-checklist/#limit-capabilities","title":"Limit capabilities","text":"","tags":["checklist","k8s","kubernetes","best practices","production"]},{"location":"sre-platform-devops/check-lists/k8s-best-pratices-checklist/#prevent-privilege-escalation","title":"Prevent privilege escalation","text":"<p>You should run your container with privilege escalation turned off to prevent escalating privileges using <code>setuid</code> or <code>setgid</code> binaries.</p>","tags":["checklist","k8s","kubernetes","best practices","production"]},{"location":"sre-platform-devops/check-lists/k8s-best-pratices-checklist/#enable-network-policies","title":"Enable network policies","text":"<p>Kubernetes network policies specify the access permissions for groups of pods, much like security groups in the cloud are used to control access to VM instances.</p> <p>In other words, it creates firewalls between pods running on a Kubernetes cluster.</p> <p>If you are not familiar with Network Policies, you can read Securing Kubernetes Cluster Networking.</p>","tags":["checklist","k8s","kubernetes","best practices","production"]},{"location":"sre-platform-devops/check-lists/k8s-best-pratices-checklist/#theres-a-conservative-networkpolicy-in-every-namespace","title":"There's a conservative NetworkPolicy in every namespace","text":"","tags":["checklist","k8s","kubernetes","best practices","production"]},{"location":"sre-platform-devops/check-lists/k8s-best-pratices-checklist/#role-based-access-control-rbac-policies","title":"Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies","text":"<p>It's common practice to give away the least permission needed, but what is practical and how do you quantify the least privilege?</p> <p>Fine-grained policies provide greater security but require more effort to administrate.</p> <p>Broader grants can give unnecessary API access to service accounts but are easier to controls.</p> <p>Should you create a single policy per namespace and share it?</p> <p>Or perhaps it's better to have them on a more granular basis?</p> <p>There's no one-size-fits-all approach, and you should judge your requirements case by case.</p> <p>But where do you start?</p> <p>If you start with a Role with empty rules, you can add all the resources that you need one by one and still be sure that you're not giving away too much.</p> <p>Please note that the default ServiceAccount is automatically mounted into the file system of all Pods.</p> <p>You might want to disable that and provide more granular policies.</p> <p>It's challenging to find good advice on how to set up your RBAC rules.

code</li> </ul> Modern programming languages come with logging packages that allow you to add lines of text to a log file as the application is running. Taking advantage of these packages will give you a papertrail of what your application is doing as users interact with it. Smart use of logging will allow you to spot bugs in your code, diagnose incorrect behavior in your application, troubleshoot user issuers, and raise alerts when cyber-attacks occur. <ul> <li> Key Elements in Log Statements</li> </ul> <p>Each entry written to a log file should contain a timestamp, the log message, and an indication of where in the code the entry is being written from - in other words, the code file and line number. Depending on what type of functionality the code is handling, it is also useful to include some of the following:</p> <ul> <li> The server name if more than one server is writing to the log file.</li> <li> The URL, HTTP status code and incoming IP address if the code is handling an incoming HTTP request.</li> <li> The username if the code is being executed in response to an action by a logged-in user.</li> <li> Timing information if the code is executing a time-sensitive action.</li> <li> Diagnostic information - for instance, if any action had to re-tried, or if a component is responding slowly.</li> <li> Error messages and stack traces if an error occurs.</li> </ul> <ul> <li> What Events to Log</li> </ul> <p>You should log every HTTP request and the corresponding response, being sure to include the URL, the HTTP response code, and the time taken to service the request. You should also log any significant actions performed by your web application, including:</p> <ul> <li> Input validation failures, e.g. when the code encounters unexpected parameter names or values.</li> <li> Authentication successes and failures.</li> <li> Authorization (access control) failures.</li> <li> Session management failures, e.g. when session cookies are rejected as invalid.</li> <li> Application errors and system events.</li> <li> Startup and shutdown events - including timing information!</li> <li> User events like sign-ups, password changes and account deletions.</li> <li> Administrative events, e.g. when permissions are changed by an admin.</li> <li> Calls to third-party services or APIs.</li> <li> Legal and other opt-ins, e.g. when a user accepts the terms of use.</li> </ul> <ul> <li> Log Levels</li> </ul> By convention, most logging packages allow you to mark logging statements with one of at least four \u201clog levels\u201d - typically named DEBUG, INFO, WARNING and ERROR, in order of importance. You should mark each logging statement with an appropriate log level to make it easy to filter out the noise in log files. Servers can be configured so only statements marked with a particular log level are written to the log file: a server configured with the INFO log-level will write INFO, WARNING and ERROR messages to the log file, but omit DEBUG messages. Low-level diagnostic events should be marked as DEBUG statements, and typically only show up in non-production environments. The INFO log level should be used for normal running: the events expected to occur when users interact with your website. Unexpected events should be logged with the WARNING level, and errors should be marked with the ERROR log level. <ul> <li> Make sure your team has access to these logs too when diagnosing issues.</li> </ul> In addition to the logging statements added to your code, other applications in your stack will typically output log files. A web server like Apache, Nginx or IIS will log HTTP request and response information. Databases will typically write log files too, which are useful for diagnosing performance issues. <ul> <li> log aggregation and storage</li> </ul> Logs should be centralized and stored securely so they can be viewed by administrators. \u201cLog servers\u201d like LogStash, Graylog, Splunk and PaperTrail will aggregate log files from different sources and allow them to be searched and analyzed in realtime. Log servers are often available as services, and can be added as plug-ins if you run on cloud-based services. <ul> <li> monitoring is paired with logging</li> </ul> The process of continuously assessing whether your site is running as expected. Monitoring software often pulls key \u201cmetrics\u201d from log files to diagnose the health of a web application. Let\u2019s discuss the various ways you can monitor your application. <ul> <li> Uptime Monitoring is in place</li> </ul> The most basic form of monitoring is checking that your site is available. \u201cUptime monitors\u201d like Uptime Robot and Pingdom are free services that will check whether a URL is responding to HTTP requests successfully. (More complex or frequent checks are usually available as a paid option.) This is a simple way to achieve peace-of-mind: if your site ever becomes unavailable, the monitoring software will send an email or text alert to your team. <ul> <li> Error Reporting</li> </ul> Capturing unexpected errors that occur on your website is key to detecting cyber-attacks and ensuring software quality. Errors conditions can either be extracted from log files, or recorded using plug-ins provided by services like Rollbar or Airbrake. Error reporting services even allow you to capture error conditions that occur in JavaScript in the browser, which typically won\u2019t appear in server-side logs. <ul> <li> Performance Metrics</li> </ul> Capturing performance metrics will give you granular information about the state of your web application. Your monitoring should keep track of: <ul> <li> Responsiveness: how long it takes to respond to each web request.</li> <li> Throughput: how many requests per second are hitting your site.</li> <li> Memory usage and server load: how much of each server\u2019s memory space is being used up, and how close each server is to full capacity.</li> <li> Database performance: how many queries are being run per second and how many concurrent connections there are.</li> </ul> <ul> <li> Alerting</li> </ul> You should configure your monitoring software to alert your team when unusual errors occur or when performance metrics reach critical conditions. Alerts can be sent over email, instant messaging or text. Large organizations will have support rotas, so at least one engineer is available to respond to alerts at all times. <ul> <li> Response Plans</li> </ul> Being alerted to errors is only useful if there are actions your support engineers can undertake to fix the error condition! Make sure you put together a trouble-shooting plan for a responding engineer to follow, and keep it up to date as you develop your system. Troubleshooting steps may consist of restarting servers, adding extra servers in times of high load, blacklisting IP addresses when you see malicious traffic, or escalating to team specialists (like network engineers and database administrators) when particular parts of the application appear to be the problem. If the issue starts to affect users, making an announcement on a status page or in a website banner will earn you goodwill. <ul> <li> What Not to Log</li> </ul> <p>Writing sensitive information to your logs is a security risk - imagine what an attacker could do if they stole your log files! Make sure your logging statements never contain any of the following:</p> <ul> <li> User or system passwords.</li> <li> Encryption keys.</li> <li> Database connection strings.</li> <li> API keys for third-party services.</li> <li> Personally identifiable information about users.</li> <li> Payment information like credit card numbers.</li> <li> Sensitive HTTP headers, such as Authorization headers.</li> <li> Session IDs or session cookies.</li> <li> Access tokens - for example, those used during sign-ups or password resets.</li> <li> Information a user has opted out of collection.

Regardless of your environment you always need to configure Vault to use SSL certificates. Moreover, if you\u2019re using a load balancer or a proxy, you shouldn\u2019t terminate the SSL connection to the Vault service. Make sure to provision and update Vault\u2019s SSL certificates in time.</p> <p>High Availability. In a production environment where microservices rely on a centralized secret store, it is critical to avoid downtime and make this store reliable. There are a number of backends that can be used in conjunction with Vault to create a Highly Available service.</p> <p>Auto-Unseal. This requirement is strongly related to the previous one. Vault starts in a \u2018sealed\u2019 state. Since version 1.0, Vault has an auto-unseal feature that is based on cloud services: Amazon KMS, Azure Key Vault, AliCloud KMS, and Google Cloud KMS. Consider creating a proper cloud policy to grant Vault permissions to use the appropriate KMS.</p> <p>Load Balancer configuration. It is important to note that you need to configure your Load Balancer to route traffic only to \u201chealthy\u201d Vault replicas. As we said earlier, once the Vault has started, it has a \u201csealed\u201d state. You need to keep in mind that in HA mode your replicas will have separate states. And if one replica restarts, it would take some time for auto-unseal to perform. Make sure that your load balancer checks if the replica is in the \u201cunsealed\u201d state before routing the traffic to it.</p> <p>Vault upgrade strategy. Vault is actively developed by the community and new versions are released frequently. It is critical to minimize the risks and upgrade Vault regularly along with new bug and security fixes. In the HA mode, you need to pay attention to the upgrade strategy. Each node must be stopped gracefully one-by-one starting from the active node. This will guarantee that the data won\u2019t be corrupted or lost.</p> <p>Underlying infrastructure upgrade strategy. Vault is always run on top of the operating system. The underlying infrastructure is run on Bare metal, VM or containers. Unfortunately, all of these options can have potential undiscovered vulnerabilities. Always have a strategy to upgrade your underlying software and avoid critical issues.</p> <p>Firewall configuration. Regardless of the environments, one of the most powerful ways to secure your Vault service is to restrict traffic from untrusted sources. The outgoing Vault traffic must be restricted as well. If it is possible, configure your underlying firewall to allow traffic only from your applications and services that need to connect to Vault.</p> <p>Linux as the main OS. While Vault can be run on different operating systems, the official Hashicorp recommendation is simple and straightforward: use Linux. The reason for this is that Vault\u2019s source code is optimized to use Linux kernel API to manage memory access securely.</p> <p>SSH access. The node that is running Vault must be only accessed by the Vault API. Avoid exposing any RPC access to the underlying infrastructure. The information about the Vault service can be accessed using the Audit and Telemetry data.</p> <p>Auditing. Vault supports special audit logs that trace in detail how the service was queried. These logs are disabled by default for simplicity, but in production systems, it is highly recommended to enable it. Vault can be configured to write audit logs into multiple \u201caudit devices\u201d: File, Syslog, and Socket. There is one critical pitfall regarding Vault\u2019s auditing mechanism that is often overlooked by newcomers:</p> <p>If you have only one audit device enabled, and it is blocking (network block, etc.), then Vault will be unresponsive. Vault will not complete any requests until the audit device can write.</p> <p>In production, it is recommended to use multiple devices at once to mitigate the risks of unresponsive Vault service.</p> <p>As we restrict the access to Vault nodes, it is a good practice to send audit logs into a separate log aggregation system, e.g. ELK.</p> <p>Isolated process. Consider running Vault as a single process on the system. You can isolate your service using a VM or a container. The official Hashicorp infrastructure priority is the following: Bare metal &gt; VMs &gt; Containers. Make sure that there are no other separate processes that can be compromised to corrupt the Vault process.</p> <p>Disable Swap &amp; Core Dumps. Even the Vault is a stateless service\u200a\u2014\u200athere is some sensitive data that is being kept in memory. Keeping this in mind, it is highly recommended to configure the underlying operating system to disable swap. This will reduce the risk of cashing sensitive data to disk. Along with swap, it is recommended to turn off core dumps to disable access to the Vault\u2019s internal memory by users and processes.</p> <p>Telemetry. Hashicorp products often expose the telemetry interface, and Vault is not an exception. Vault delivers a variety of useful metrics about itself. In production, it is useful to track the performance of your Backend Storage operations. Vault can be configured to send the metrics to the particular upstream service, e.g. StatsD.</p>","tags":["checklist","vault","best practices","readiness","hashicorp"]},{"location":"sre-platform-devops/check-lists/vault-checklist/#setting-up-maintaining-storage-backend","title":"Setting up &amp; maintaining Storage Backend","text":"<p>One of the underlying challenges in a production-ready Vault service is to manage the Vault\u2019s storage backend.

Well, we use something known as an error budget to figure this out. An error budget is basically the inverse of availability, and it tells us how unreliable your service is allowed to be. If your SLO says that 99.9 percent of requests should be successful in a given quarter, your error budget allows 0.1 percent of requests to fail. This unavailability can be generated as a result of bad pushes by the product teams, planned maintenance, hardware failures, et cetera. Let's look at error budgets in terms of time. 0.1 percent unavailability times 28 days in the four-week window, times 24 hours in a day, times 60 minutes in an hour is equal to 40.32 minutes of downtime per month. This is just about enough time for your monitoring systems to surface an issue, and for a human to investigate and fix it. And that only allows for one incident per month. As you can see, that's not a lot of time at all. When you come up with your SLOs, you and your product teams, and ideally your leadership are also agreeing not to spend all of this error budget. You want to find a happy medium where you can still have development velocity and user happiness without burning through your error budget. Think of the budget as a household budget. It's there to be spent on things you want, such as rolling out new software versions, which might break, releasing new features, plan downtime, inevitable failure in hardware, networks, power, et cetera. You shouldn't overspend it, but that's not to say you can't spend it at all. If you look at your error budget for your SLOs over standard time period like 28 days, you may see that you've used 90 percent of your error budget. In this case, 36.28 minutes of unavailability a month. No need to panic. In general, you shouldn't care whether you've used 10 percent, 25 percent, or 70 percent of your error budget in the past 28 days. But you should care if you've used 110 percent. If you don't have the budget, you need to take action to make your service more reliable, and protect users from additional unavailability. There are many benefits to using error budgets. Because you and your product teams have to maintain their budget, it is a common incentive for your developers and your reliability engineers. It's shared between the two teams and helps strike a balance between innovation and reliability. It allows your Dev team to manage the risks themselves, and self-regulate by figuring out what to spend the error budget on such as more changes, faster pushes, or riskier features. And unrealistic reliability goals become unattractive because they dampen the velocity of innovation without providing benefit.</p> <p>Characteristics</p> <ul> <li>The inverse of an SLO.

An effective canarying strategy and good monitoring can reduce the Mean Time To Detect these problems, and dramatically reduce the number of affected users.</p> <p>Ideally, your team has a stack that is multihomed and provisioned in such a way that you have at least one instance you can divert from live traffic and temporarily loan to a learning exercise. Alternatively, you might have a smaller, but still fully featured, staging or QA instance of your stack that can be borrowed for a short time. If possible, subject the stack to synthetic load that approximates real user/client traffic, in addition to resource consumption, if possible.</p> <p>The opportunities for learning from a real production system under synthetic load are abundant. Senior SREs will have experienced all sorts of troubles: misconfigurations, memory leaks, performance regressions, crashing queries, storage bottlenecks, and so forth. In this realistic but relatively risk-free environment, proctors can manipulate the job set in ways that alter the behavior of the stack, forcing new SREs to find differences, determine contributing factors, and ultimately repair systems to restore appropriate behavior.</p> <p>As an alternative to the overhead of asking a senior SRE to carefully plan a specific type of breakage that the new SRE(s) must repair, you can also work in the opposite direction with an exercise that may also increase participation from the entire team: work from a known good configuration and slowly impair the stack at selected bottlenecks, observing upstream and downstream efforts through your monitoring.</p> <p>How you apply these practices is up to you, but the charge is clear: as SRE, you have to scale your humans faster than you scale your machines.</p> <p>** Cognitive Flow **</p> <p>People enjoy performing tasks they know how to do. In fact, executing such tasks is one of the clearest paths to cognitive flow. Some SREs are on-call when they reach a state of cognitive flow. It can be very fulfilling to chase down the causes of problems, work with others, and improve the overall health of the system in such a tangible way</p> <p>On the other hand, when a person is concentrating full-time on interrupts, interrupts stop being interrupts. At a very visceral level, making incremental improvements to the system, whacking tickets, and fixing problems and outages becomes a clear set of goals, boundaries, and clear feedback: you close X bugs, or you stop getting paged. All that\u2019s left is distractions. When you\u2019re doing interrupts, your projects are a distraction. Even though interrupts may be a satisfying use of time in the short term, in a mixed project/on-call environment, people are ultimately happier with a balance between these two types of work. The ideal balance varies from engineer to engineer. It\u2019s important to be aware that some engineers may not actually know what balance best motivates them (or might think they know, but you may disagree).</p> <p>Polarizing time means that when a person comes into work each day, they should know if they\u2019re doing just project work or just interrupts. Polarizing their time in this way means they get to concentrate for longer periods of time on the task at hand. They don\u2019t get stressed out because they\u2019re being roped into tasks that drag them away from the work they\u2019re supposed to be doing.</p> <p>** Notes **</p> <p>For any given class of interrupt, if the volume of interrupts is too high for one person, add another person. This concept most obviously applies to tickets, but can potentially apply to pages, too\u2014the on-call can start bumping things to their secondary, or downgrading pages to tickets.</p> <p>A person should never be expected to be on-call and also make progress on projects (or anything else with a high context switching cost).</p> <p>Your team should conduct a regular scrub for tickets and pages, in which you examine classes of interrupts to see if you can identify a root cause. If you think the root cause is fixable in a reasonable amount of time, then silence the interrupts until the root cause is expected to be fixed.</p> <p>Remember:  Your team sets the level of service provided by your service.  It\u2019s OK to push back some of the effort onto your customer</p> <p>Remember that your job is to make the service work, not to shield the development team from alerts.</p> <p>To give acceptable on-call support for a component, you should at least know the consequences when it breaks and the urgency needed to fix problems.</p> <p>After scoping the dynamics and pain points of the team, lay the groundwork for improvement through best practices like postmortems and by identifying sources of toil and how to best address them.</p> <p>If you find yourself on a team without SLOs, first read Service Level Objectives, then get the tech leads and management in a room and start arbitrating.</p> <p>The preceding detailed discussions often lead to actions that SRE needs to take\u2014fix this, monitor that, develop a subsystem to do the other. Track these improvements just as they would be tracked in any other meeting: assign action items to people and track their progress.</p> <p>Work done by SREs must be highly visible and sufficiently reviewed by the development team to ensure effective knowledge sharing. SREs should essentially work as a part of the development team, rather than an external unit.</p> <p>** Issues needs triage **</p> <p>Common alerts that aren't diagnosed by either the dev team or SREs. Such alerts are frequently triaged as transient, but still distract your teammates from fixing real problems. Either investigate such alerts fully, or fix the alerting rules.</p> <p>An issue that probably should have paged, but didn't. In these cases, you should probably fix the monitoring so that such events do trigger a page. Often you encounter the issue while you're trying to fix something else, or it's related to a metric you're tracking but for which you haven't got an alert.</p> <p>An issue that is not pageable but requires attention, such as low-impact data corruption or slowness in some non-user-facing dimension of the system. Tracking reactive operational work is also appropriate here. These alerts should be removed, because they create extra noise that distracts engineers from issues that do merit attention.</p> <p>** Prioritization **</p> <p>SRE teams sometimes fall into ops mode because they focus on how to quickly address emergencies instead of how to reduce the number of emergencies. After you've learned enough about the service to ask hard questions about its design and deployment, spend some time prioritizing various service outages according to their impact on the team's stress levels.</p>","tags":["sre","notes","google","platform"]},{"location":"sre-platform-devops/notes/google/#the-sre-engagement-model","title":"The SRE Engagement Model","text":"<p>SRE seeks production responsibility for important services for which it can make concrete contributions to reliability.

You've got this message because the scdaemon that you're accessing (via its socket) is not the one that has ownership of the Yubikey right now.

A simple 'kill' will not cause scdaemon to exit, and this is nicer than doing a kill -9.
